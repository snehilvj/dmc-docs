Dash Mantine Components includes over 100 customizable components based on the React Mantine library, with consistent styling, theming, and full support for light and dark mode.  \nCategory: General  \n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\npip install dash-mantine-components\n```\n\n```bash\npoetry add dash-mantine-components\n```\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Dash\n\napp = Dash()\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    dmc.Alert(\n       \"Welcome to Dash Mantine Components\",\n       title=\"Hello!\",\n       color=\"violet\",\n    )\n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n\n### Important Notes \n\n\n#### Wrap the layout with `MantineProvider`\n\n```python\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n   # your content\n)\n```\n\nThe `MantineProvider` is a core wrapper component that handles global styles, themes, and settings for all child components.\n\nIt’s required to:\n\n- Enable component styling and theming (e.g., colors, fonts, spacing)\n\n- Apply dark/light mode\n\n- Customize default props across the app\n\n- Register custom themes or override styles\n\n#### Using Dash 2.x?\nYou must set React to version 18.2.0:\n```python\n# required for dash 2.x\nimport dash\ndash._dash_renderer._set_react_version(\"18.2.0\")\n```\n\n#### Using DMC < 1.2.0?\n\nIf you are using DMC < 1.2.0 it is required to include additional stylesheets for certain components. See the\n[migration guide](/migration) for more information.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThis documentation site is built almost entirely with Dash Mantine Components.\nYou can explore the source code on the [dcm-docs GitHub](https://github.com/snehilvj/dmc-docs)  for ideas and inspiration.\n\nThroughout the docs, you’ll find interactive demos that highlight how different props and combinations affect each component in real time.\n\nNote that this documentation has some additional styling applied to it. So when you actually use these components, they \nmight look a bit different. You can check out [MantineProvider theme object](/theme-object) for more details on\ntheming and customizations and to see the [theme used in these docs.](/theme-object#usage-in-dmc-docs)\n\n\n### Next Steps\n\nPlease read the [Mantine API Overview](/mantine-api) section before starting development to learn about all of the\navailable theming and styling features.\n\n### Questions?\n\nPlease ask on the [dash community forum](https://community.plotly.com/), or join our [Discord.](https://discord.gg/KuJkh4Pyq5)"

Type `@Docs` in your prompt\n2. Reference the DMC documentation URL: `https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/assets/llms.txt`\n3. Ask questions about DMC components, styling, or implementation\n\nTip: You’ll get even better results if you upload your customized `llms.txt` file directly or reference it locally instead of the full version.\n\n#### Windsurf\n1. Reference the documentation using `@https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/assets/llms.txt`\n2. Or add your custom file path to your `.windsurfrules` file for persistent access\n3. Smaller, project-specific files make Windsurf faster to index and query.\n\n#### ChatGPT & Claude\n1. Mention that you're using Dash Mantine Components v2.\n2. Reference the documentation URL: `https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/assets/llms.txt`\n3. For best results, upload your customized llms.txt (containing only the components used in your app). This improves\nthe model’s ability to generate correct code using DMC props.\n\n#### GitHub Copilot\n\nWhile Copilot doesn't directly support external documentation, you can:\n\n1. Include relevant documentation snippets or short versions of `llms.txt` in your project.\n2. Reference component names and props accurately in comments for better inline completions.\n\n\n\n### Example Prompts\n\nHere are some example prompts you can use with AI tools:\n\n* \"Using Dash Mantine Components v2, how do I create a dark mode toggle?\"\n* \"Show me how to use the AppShell component with a collapsible navbar\"\n* \"How can I customize the theme colors in MantineProvider?\"\n* \"How to align input with a button in a flex container?\"\n* \"Refer only to my custom llms.txt file (layout and feedback components) for examples.\"\n\n\n\n### Documentation Generation\n\nThe LLM documentation is automatically generated from our source files.  To ensure you have the latest documentation, \nwe regenerate the `llms.txt` file with each release.  The file follows the [LLMs.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) standard\nfor better compatibility with AI tools.\n\n### Creating a Custom llms.txt File\n\nYou’ll get the best results by using  only the sections of the documentation that you need. \n\n\n#### Option 1 — Download using customization app\nUse the interactive tool below to select specific component categories (for example, layout, inputs, feedback) or individual components (like `AppShell`, `Card`, or `Button`), then download your file.\n\n#### Option 2 — Build your own from llms.json\n\nYou can also manually create your own `llms.txt` file using the structured data in  [llms.json](https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/assets/llms.json).\n\nEach entry in `llms.json` represents one documentation page, including fields like `name`, `description`, `category`,\nand full `content`.  You can filter and combine only the components you need — for example, by category or name.\n\n#### Option 3 — Use the “Copy for LLMs” feature\n\nEach documentation page includes a “Copy for LLMs” button that copies that page’s content in LLM-friendly format.\nUse this when you want to paste a few pages directly into a chat session (e.g. ChatGPT or Cursor) without downloading the entire documentation.\n\nUse this for quick one-off conversations, when you only need to reference one or two components.\n\n### Contributing\n\nIf you find any issues with the LLM documentation or have suggestions for improvement, please [open an issue](https://github.com/snehilvj/dmc-docs/issues) on our documentation GitHub repository."

    "content": "\n\n## Mantine API Overview  \nA guide to help you get familiar with core Mantine concepts.  \nCategory: General  \n\n### MantineProvider\n\nWrap your `app.layout` with a `MantineProvider` to manage your app’s overall theme, including colors, spacing, fonts,\nand light/dark mode. It also exposes Mantine CSS variables based on your theme settings.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Dash\napp = Dash()\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    # children=[] your layout here\n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n\n```\n\n\n### Light Dark Color scheme  \n\nAll Mantine components support light, dark and auto color schemes.\n\nThe default color scheme is light.  You can set the default color scheme on `MantineProvider`:\n\nSee the Theming section for examples of a [Theme Switch Component](/theme-switch)\n\n\n\n### Theme object\n\nMantine’s  [default theme](/theme-object#default-theme) makes Dash apps look great in both light and dark modes. If you’re new to Dash Mantine Components,\nstart with the default theme. You can customize the theme globally by editing the `theme` prop in the `MantineProvider`.\n\nThe `theme` object is a dictionary where you can set things like colors, border radius, spacing, fonts, and breakpoints globally.\nMantine will merge your custom theme with the defaults, so you just need to provide what you want to change.\n\nSee the [Theme Object documentation](/theme-object) for all options.\n\n\n```python\n# Your theme  is merged with default theme\ntheme = {\n    \"fontFamily\": \"Montserrat, sans-serif\",\n    \"defaultRadius\": \"md\",    \n}\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    # children=[] your layout here\n    theme=theme\n)\n```\n\n\nThis example demonstrates how changing the `theme` updates the entire app’s appearance. Here, we change:\n- Primary accent color\n- Border radius\n- Card shadow style\n- Color scheme (light/dark)\n\nTry it live: [DMC Theme Builder on Pycafe](https://py.cafe/app/dash.mantine.components/dash-mantine-theme-builder)\n\n---\n\n---\n\nMost of the theme values are exposed as CSS variables and can be accessed\nboth in component props and CSS.\n\nAccessing theme values in a `.css` file in the `/assets` folder:\n\n```css\n.demo {\n  background: var(--mantine-color-red-1);\n  color: var(--mantine-color-red-9);\n  font-family: var(--mantine-font-family);\n  border-radius: var(--mantine-radius-md);\n}\n```\n\nAccessing CSS variables in the `style` or `styles` prop in a component\n\n```python\ndmc.Card(style={\"backgroundColor\":\"var(--mantine-color-red-1)\"})\n```\n\n\n\n### Component specific props\nMost of the components provide props that allow you to customize their styles. For example, `Button` component has\n`color`, `variant`, `size` and `radius` props that control its appearance:\n\n\n### Style props\n\n[Style props](/style-props) work similar to component specific props, but with several differences:\n\n- Style props are not component specific, they can be used with any component.\n- Style props always control a single CSS property. For example, `c` prop controls CSS `color` property, while `color` prop controls a set of properties: `color`, `background-color` and `border-color`.\n- Style props are set in style attribute. It is not possible to override them with CSS without using `!important`.\n\n[Style props](/style-props) are useful when you need to change a single CSS property without creating a separate file for styles. Some of the most common use cases are:\n\n\n- Changing text color and font-size\n\n```python\n\ndmc.Card([\n    dmc.Text(\"Card title\", c=\"blue.8\", fz=\"lg\"),\n    dmc.Text(\"Card description\", c=\"dimmed\", fz=\"sm\")\n])\n```\n\n- Applying margins to inputs inside a form:\n\n```python\ndmc.Paper([\n    dmc.TextInput(label=\"First name\"),\n    dmc.TextInput(label=\"Last name\", mt=\"md\"),\n    dmc.TextInput(label=\"Email\", mt=\"md\")    \n])\n```\n\n- Adding padding to various elements:\n\n```python\ndmc.Paper(\"My custom card\", p=\"xl\")\n```\n\nNote that style props were never intended to be used as a primary way of styling components. In most cases, it is better\nto limit the number of style props used per component to 3-4. If you find yourself using more than 4 style props, \nconsider creating a separate CSS file with styles – it will be easier to maintain and will be more performant.\n\n\n### style prop\n\nYou can use the `style` prop to define inline styles, just like in other dash components:\n```python\ndmc.Card(style={\"backgroundColor\": \"blue\", \"color\": \"white\"})\n```\n\n### className prop\nYou can define CSS classes in a `.css` file in the `/assets` folder. These can then be referenced using the `className` prop, just like in other dash components:\n\n```python \ndmc.Card(className=\"card-style\")\n```\n\n.css file:\n```css\n.card-style {\n    background-color: blue;\n    color: white;\n}\n```\n\n### Styles API\n\nNote that the `style` and the `className` props will apply style to the root of the component.  Many DMC components contain\nmultiple elements, for example the `TextInput` includes `label`, `description`, `error` props.  \n\nUse the `classNames` or `styles` props to target the nested elements.  \n- `styles` prop: Used to apply inline styles directly to specific inner elements of a Mantine component.\n- `classNames`prop: Used to apply custom CSS class names to specific inner elements of a Mantine component\n\nSee more information in the [StylesAPI](/styles-api) section.\n\n\n\n### Colors\n\nColors are stored in `theme['colors']` dict and are exposed as CSS variables. Each color must have at least 10 shades.\nYou can generate new colors based on a single color value with the [Mantine colors generator](https://mantine.dev/colors-generator/).\n\nColors are numbered from 0 to 9 where 0 is the lightest and 9 is the darkest color. Example of blue color from the default theme:\n\n\nTo access colors in styles use CSS variables:\n\n```css\n.demo {\n  background: var(--mantine-color-blue-9);\n  color: var(--mantine-color-blue-0);\n}\n```\n\n### CSS variables\nTheme values are converted to [CSS variables](/css-variables) and are available to use in your styles. All Mantine CSS variables are\nprefixed with `--mantine-`, for example:\n\n- theme[\"fontFamily\"] → --mantine-font-family\n- theme[\"colors\"][\"blue\"][9] → --mantine-color-blue-9\n- theme[\"spacing\"][\"xl\"] → --mantine-spacing-xl\n\n### CSS Variables list\n\nFor a list of all Mantine CSS variables that are generated from default theme, see the [CSS variables](/css-variables) section."

    "description": "Use this component as an alternative to buttons when you just want to use an icon.",
    "endpoint": "/components/actionicon",
    "package": "dash_mantine_components",
    "category": "Buttons",
    "content": "\n\n## ActionIcon  \nUse this component as an alternative to buttons when you just want to use an icon.  \nCategory: Buttons  \n\n### Introduction\n\n### Usage\n\nActionIcon component is an alternative to [Button](/components/button) component. It can be customized with Mantine styles and used with its\n`n_clicks` property.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, html, Output, Input\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.ActionIcon(\n            DashIconify(icon=\"clarity:settings-line\", width=20),\n            size=\"lg\",\n            variant=\"filled\",\n            id=\"action-icon\",\n            n_clicks=0,\n            mb=10,\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"action-output\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"action-output\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"action-icon\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\ndef update_clicks(n_clicks):\n    return f\"Clicked {n_clicks} times.\"\n```\n### Children\nYou can use a dash component such as `DashIconify` in the `children` prop.  Note that it does not control the icon size, \nyou need to specify it manually on icon component to match `ActionIcon` size.\n\nFor example, if you were to use `DashIconify`, you can set the icon size like this:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ndmc.ActionIcon(\n    DashIconify(icon=\"bi:github\", width=20),\n    size=\"lg\"\n)\n```\n\n### Variants\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.ActionIcon(\n            DashIconify(icon=\"clarity:settings-line\"), color=\"blue\", variant=variant\n        )\n        for variant in [\n            \"subtle\",\n            \"filled\",\n            \"outline\",\n            \"light\",\n            \"default\",\n            \"transparent\",\n            \"gradient\",\n            \"white\"\n        ]\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Gradient variant\n\nWhen `variant` prop is set to `gradient`, you can control gradient with gradient prop, it accepts an object with\n`from`, `to` and `deg` properties. If the `gradient` prop is not set, `ActionIcon` will use `defaultGradient` which can\nbe configured on the `theme` dict in the `MantineProvider`. `gradient` prop is ignored when `variant` is not set to `gradient`.\n\nNote that `variant=\"gradient\"` supports only linear gradients with two colors. If you need a more complex gradient, then\nuse `Styles API` to modify `ActionIcon` styles.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.ActionIcon(\n            DashIconify(icon=\"clarity:settings-line\"),\n            color=\"blue\",\n            variant=\"gradient\",\n            gradient=gradient\n        )\n        for gradient in [\n            {\"from\": \"red\", \"to\": \"blue\", \"deg\": 90 },\n            {\"from\": \"red\", \"to\": \"blue\", \"deg\": 180},\n            {\"from\": \"teal\", \"to\": \"yellow\", \"deg\": 90},\n            {\"from\": \"teal\", \"to\": \"yellow\", \"deg\": 180}\n         ]\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Colors\n\nHere is a sample using the following colors:\n\"gray\", \"red\", \"pink\", \"grape\", \"violet\", \"indigo\", \"blue\", \"lime\", \"yellow\", \"orange\"\n\nAnd these variants:\n\"subtle\", \"filled\", \"outline\", \"light\", \"transparent\"\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ndmc.ActionIcon(\n    DashIconify(icon=\"icomoon-free:sun\"),\n    variant=\"outline\",\n    color=\"orange\",\n)\n```\n\n\n###  Size\n\nYou can use any valid CSS value in `size` prop, it is used to set `width`, `min-width`, `min-height` and `height`\nproperties. Note that `size` prop does not control child icon size, you need to set it manually on icon component.\nWhen size is a number, the value is treated as `px` units and converted to `rem` units.\n\n```python\ndmc.ActionIcon(size=20, children=[...])\n```\n\nIf you want `ActionIcon` to have the same size as Mantine inputs, use `size=\"input-sm\"` prop:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group([\n    dmc.TextInput(placeholder=\"sm sixe input\", size=\"sm\"),\n    dmc.ActionIcon(\n        size=\"input-sm\",\n        variant=\"default\",\n        children=\"SM\"\n    )\n])\n```\n### Loading state\nWhen `loading` prop is set, `ActionIcon` will be disabled and `Loader` with overlay will be rendered in the center of \nthe button. Loader color depends on `ActionIcon` variant.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n    dmc.Group(\n        [\n            dmc.ActionIcon(\n                id=\"icon-loading-default\",\n                children=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:heart\", width=18, height=18)\n            ),\n            dmc.ActionIcon(\n                id=\"icon-loading-light\",\n                children=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:heart\", width=18, height=18),\n                variant=\"light\",\n            ),\n            dmc.ActionIcon(\n                id=\"icon-loading-outline\",\n                children=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:heart\", width=18, height=18),\n                variant=\"outline\",\n            ),\n        ]\n    ),\n    dmc.Switch(\n        id=\"loading-switch\",\n        label=\"Loading state\",\n        checked=False,\n        mt=\"md\",\n    ),\n])\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"icon-loading-default\", \"loading\"),\n    Output(\"icon-loading-light\", \"loading\"),\n    Output(\"icon-loading-outline\", \"loading\"),\n    Input(\"loading-switch\", \"checked\"),\n)\ndef toggle_loading(loading_state):\n    return loading_state, loading_state, loading_state\n```\n### Loader props\nYou can customize Loader with `loaderProps` prop, it accepts all props that `Loader` component has:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.ActionIcon(size=\"xl\", loading=True, loaderProps={\"type\": \"dots\"})\n```\n### Add custom variants\n\nTo add new `ActionIcon` variants, define a class in the `.css` file using the data-variant attribute. Add the new variants to\nthe `theme` prop in the `MantineProvider` so they available in all `ActionIcon` components in your app.\n\n\nExample:\n - [View Code on GitHub](https://github.com/snehilvj/dmc-docs/tree/main/help_center/theme/action_icon_custom_variants.py)  \n - [Live Demo on PyCafe](https://py.cafe/dash.mantine.components/actionicon-custom-variants-demo)  \n\n\nThe example includes the following in a .css file in /assets\n```css\n.ai-custom-variants {\n  &[data-variant='danger'] {\n    background-color: var(--mantine-color-red-9);\n    color: var(--mantine-color-red-0);\n  }\n\n  &[data-variant='primary'] {\n    background: linear-gradient(45deg, #4b6cb7 10%, #253b67 90%);\n    color: var(--mantine-color-white);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe example adds the custom variants to the `theme` prop in `Mantine Provider`\n\n```python\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n   children=[# your app content],\n   theme={\n      \"components\": {\n           \"ActionIcon\": {\"classNames\": {\"root\": \"ai-custom-variants\"}}\n       }\n   }\n)\n```\n \n### autoContrast\n`ActionIcon` supports `autoContrast` prop.  You can also set `autoContrast` in the `theme` prop in the `MantineProvider`.\nIf `autoContrast` is set either on `ActionIcon` or on `theme`, content color will be adjusted to have sufficient\ncontrast with the value specified in `color` prop.\n\nNote that `autoContrast` feature works only if you use `color` prop to change background color. `autoContrast` works\nonly with `filled` variant.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.ActionIcon(\n            children=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:heart\", width=18, height=18),\n            color=\"lime.3\"\n        ),\n        dmc.ActionIcon(\n            children=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:heart\", width=18, height=18),\n            color=\"lime.3\",\n            autoContrast=True\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### ActionIconGroup\n\n\n```python\n\ndmc.ActionIconGroup(\n    [\n        dmc.ActionIcon(\n            variant=\"default\",\n            size=\"lg\",\n            children=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:photo\", width=20),\n        ),\n        dmc.ActionIcon(\n            variant=\"default\",\n            size=\"lg\",\n            children=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:settings\", width=20),        \n        ),\n        dmc.ActionIcon(\n            variant=\"default\",\n            size=\"lg\",\n            children=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:heart\", width=20),\n        ),\n    ],\n    orientation=\"horizontal\"\n)\n```\n\nNote that you must not wrap child `ActionIcon` components with any additional elements:\n\n```python\ndmc.ActionIconGroup([\n    html.Div(dmc.ActionIcon(...)),  # don't do it like this\n    dmc.ActionIcon(...)\n])\n```\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element.

    "category": "Buttons",
    "content": "\n\n## Button  \nDMC alternative to html.Button.  \nCategory: Buttons  \n\n### Introduction\n\n### Variant\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Default button\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Subtle button\", variant=\"subtle\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Gradient button\", variant=\"gradient\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Filled button\", variant=\"filled\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Light button\", variant=\"light\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Outline button\", variant=\"outline\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Transparent\", variant=\"transparent\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"White\", variant=\"white\"),\n    ]\n)\n```\n#### Gradient Variant\n\nTo use gradient as Button background:\n\n* set `variant` prop to \"gradient\"\n* set `gradient` prop to `{ 'from': 'color-from', 'to': 'color-to', 'deg': 135}`, where\n\n  * `color-from` and `color-to` are colors from Mantine's theme colors.\n  * `deg` is linear gradient deg.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    children=[\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Indigo cyan\",\n            variant=\"gradient\",\n            gradient={\"from\": \"indigo\", \"to\": \"cyan\"},\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Lime green\",\n            variant=\"gradient\",\n            gradient={\"from\": \"teal\", \"to\": \"lime\", \"deg\": 105},\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Teal blue\",\n            variant=\"gradient\",\n            gradient={\"from\": \"teal\", \"to\": \"blue\", \"deg\": 60},\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Orange red\",\n            variant=\"gradient\",\n            gradient={\"from\": \"orange\", \"to\": \"red\"},\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Grape pink\",\n            variant=\"gradient\",\n            gradient={\"from\": \"grape\", \"to\": \"pink\", \"deg\": 35},\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Left and right sections  \n\n`leftSection` and `rightSection` allow adding icons or any other element to the left and right side of the button.\nWhen a section is added, padding on the corresponding side is reduced.\n\nNote that `leftSection` and `rightSection` are flipped in RTL mode (`leftSection` is displayed on the right and `rightSection` is displayed on the left).\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Connect to Database\",\n            leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"fluent:database-plug-connected-20-filled\"),\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Load Data\",\n            variant=\"subtle\",\n            rightSection=DashIconify(icon=\"logos:twitter\"),\n            color=\"blue\",\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Settings\",\n            variant=\"outline\",\n            leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"fluent:settings-32-regular\"),\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Sections position\n`justify` prop sets `justify-content` of inner element. You can use it to change the alignment of left and right sections.\nFor example, to spread them across the button set `justify='space-between'`.\n\nIf you need to align just one section to the side of the button, set `justify` to `space-between` and add empty `html.Span()` to the opposite section.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\nfrom dash import html\n\nicon = DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:photo\", width=14)\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Button label\",\n            justify=\"center\",\n            fullWidth=True,\n            leftSection=icon,\n            rightSection=icon,\n            variant=\"default\",\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Button label\",\n            justify=\"center\",\n            fullWidth=True,\n            leftSection=icon,\n            variant=\"default\",\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Button label\",\n            justify=\"center\",\n            fullWidth=True,\n            rightSection=icon,\n            variant=\"default\",\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Button label\",\n            justify=\"center\",\n            fullWidth=True,\n            leftSection=html.Span(),  # Empty spacer\n            rightSection=icon,\n            variant=\"default\",\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n### Loading State\n\nStarting with dash version 2.9.2, you can use duplicate callback outputs. Here's an example that lets you easily show\nloading state while the callback is running.   Note that the button is disabled automatically when `loading=True`\n\n```python\nimport uuid\nfrom time import sleep\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, callback, Output, Input, clientside_callback\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Load from database\",\n            id=\"loading-button\",\n            leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"fluent:database-plug-connected-20-filled\"),\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"clicked-output\", mt=10),\n    ]\n)\n\nclientside_callback(\n    \"\"\"\n    function updateLoadingState(n_clicks) {\n        return true\n    }\n    \"\"\",\n    Output(\"loading-button\", \"loading\", allow_duplicate=True),\n    Input(\"loading-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True,\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"clicked-output\", \"children\"),\n    Output(\"loading-button\", \"loading\"),\n    Input(\"loading-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True,\n)\ndef load_from_db(n_clicks):\n    sleep(3)\n    return str(uuid.uuid4()), False\n```\n### Loader Props\n\nYou can customize [Loader](/components/loader) with `loaderProps` prop, it accepts all props that Loader component has:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Button(\"Loading Props\", loaderProps={\"type\": \"dots\"}, loading=True)\n```\n### Colors\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Button(\"Settings\", color=\"red\")\n```\n\n### Radius and Size\n\nButton's radius and size can be customized by setting `radius` and `size` props. Both props have predefined values:\nxs, sm, md, lg, xl. Alternatively, you can use a number to set radius, size in px.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Connect to Database\", size=\"sm\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Notify\", radius=\"xl\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Settings\", size=20),\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n### Compact Size\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nsizes = [\"xs\", \"sm\", \"md\", \"lg\", \"xl\"]\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.Group(\n            [dmc.Button(f\"Normal {size}\", size=size) for size in sizes],\n        ),\n        dmc.Group(\n            [dmc.Button(f\"Compact {size}\", size=f\"compact-{size}\") for size in sizes],\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Full Width Button\n\nPass `fullWidth=True` for a full width button.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Button(\"Click to open the app\", fullWidth=True, variant=\"outline\")\n```\n### Add custom variants\n\nTo add new `Button` variants, define a class in the `.css` file using the `data-variant` attribute. Add the new variants to\nthe `theme` prop in the `MantineProvider` so they available in all `Button` components in your app.\n\n\nExample:\n - [View Code on GitHub](https://github.com/snehilvj/dmc-docs/tree/main/help_center/theme/button_custom_variants.py)  \n - [Live Demo on PyCafe](https://py.cafe/dash.mantine.components/button-custom-variants-demo-0)  \n \n\nThe example includes the following in a .css file in /assets\n```css\n.button-custom-variants {\n  &[data-variant='danger'] {\n    background-color: var(--mantine-color-red-9);\n    color: var(--mantine-color-red-0);\n  }\n\n  &[data-variant='primary'] {\n    background: linear-gradient(45deg, #4b6cb7 10%, #253b67 90%);\n    color: var(--mantine-color-white);\n    border-width: 0;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe example adds the custom variants to the `theme` prop in `Mantine Provider`\n\n```python\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n   children=[# your app content],\n   theme={\n      \"components\": {\n           \"Button\": {\"classNames\": {\"root\": \"button-custom-variants\"}}\n       }\n   }\n)\n```\n\n\n### Button Group\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.ButtonGroup(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"First\", variant=\"outline\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Second\", variant=\"outline\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Third\", variant=\"outline\"),\n    ]\n)\n```\nNote that you must not wrap child `Button` components with any additional elements:\n\n```python\ndmc.ButtonGroup([\n    html.Div(dmc.Button(\"This will not work\")),\n    dmc.Button(\"Buttons will have incorrect borders\")\n])\n```\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

A DMC alternative to dcc.Clipboard.  \nCategory: Buttons  \n\n### Introduction\n\n`CopyButton` is a ready-to-use clipboard button built with the Mantine `Button` component.\nIt supports props for dynamic text, icons and colors while copying plus all standard `Button` props.\n\n\n### Colors\n\nUse `color` and `copiedColor` props to change the button’s color before and after copying.\nNote - if `copiedColor` is not provided, the color will remain unchanged during copying.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.CopyButton(\n    value=\"https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/\",\n    children=\"Copy URL\",\n    color=\"blue\",\n    copiedColor=\"teal\"\n)\n```\n### Copy State Display \n\nUse `children` and `copiedChildren` to control the content of the underlying button before and after copying.\n\nThe `CopyButton` renders a Mantine `Button` internally, and `children` / `copiedChildren` are passed directly as the\nbutton’s children. For this reason, they must not contain interactive elements (for example: buttons, links, inputs,\nor other clickable controls), as nesting interactive components inside a button results in invalid HTML and accessibility issues.\n\nUse text, icons, or non-interactive Dash components (such as `Text`, `Group`, `Stack`, or `Icon` components) to customize the button content.\n\nIf you would like to use something other than a button (like an `ActionIcon`), use the `CustomCopyButton` instead.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group([\n    dmc.CopyButton(\n        value=\"https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/\",\n        children=\"Copy URL\",\n        copiedChildren=\"Copied!\",\n        color=\"blue\",\n        copiedColor=\"teal\"\n    ),\n    dmc.CopyButton(\n        value=\"This text is copied\",\n        children=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:clipboard\"),\n        copiedChildren=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:check\"),\n        color=\"blue\",\n        copiedColor=\"teal\",\n        variant=\"outline\"\n    ),\n    dmc.CopyButton(\n        value=\"This text is copied\",\n        children=DashIconify(icon=\"fa-regular:copy\"),\n        copiedChildren=DashIconify(icon=\"fa-regular:check-circle\"),\n        color=\"gray\",\n        copiedColor=\"dark\",\n        variant=\"transparent\"\n    )\n])\n```\n### Copy from another component\nUse `target_id` to copy text (or value prop) from another component instead of using a static value. No callback required!\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group([\n    dmc.Textarea(\n        \"Type here.  This text will be copied.\",\n        id=\"text-to-copy\",\n        autosize=True,\n        minRows=3,\n        w=300\n    ),\n    dmc.CopyButton(\n        target_id=\"text-to-copy\",\n        children=DashIconify(icon=\"fa-regular:copy\"),\n        copiedChildren=DashIconify(icon=\"fa-regular:check-circle\"),\n        color=\"var(--mantine-color-dimmed)\",\n        copiedColor=\"gray\",\n        variant=\"outline\",\n        size=\"xs\"\n    )\n], gap=0, align=\"flex-start\" )\n```\n### Copy in a callback\n\nSet `triggerCopy=True` to trigger the copy from a callback. This property automatically resets to `False` after copying.\n\nNote that the  `value` and `triggerCopy` properties can be updated in the same callback.\n\n\nIn this example, the `CopyButton` is hidden, and `triggerCopy` is set to `True` when the `value` of the `Select` component changes.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Input, Output, callback\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n    dmc.Select(\n        id=\"copy-select\",\n        data=[\"Job A\", \"Job B\", \"Job C\"],\n        label=\"Select Job\",\n        description=\"Results are copied to the clipboard\"\n    ),\n    dmc.Text(id=\"copy-select-output\"),\n    dmc.CopyButton(\n        id=\"copy-trigger\",\n        style={\"visibility\": \"hidden\"},\n        value=\"\"\n    )\n])\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"copy-select-output\", \"children\"),\n    Output(\"copy-trigger\", \"value\"),\n    Output(\"copy-trigger\", \"triggerCopy\"),\n    Input(\"copy-select\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update_clipboard(v):\n    results = f\"Results from {v}\"\n    return results, results, True\n```\n### Timeout\n\nThe `timeout` prop controls how long the \"copied\" state is displayed (in milliseconds). The default is 1000ms.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.CopyButton(\n    value=\"copied text\",\n    children=\"Copy\",\n    copiedChildren=\"Copied\",\n    color=\"dark.3\",\n    copiedColor=\"gray.2\",\n    autoContrast=True,\n    timeout=\"2000\"\n)\n```\n### Custom Copy Button\n\nCreate a custom copy button using a JavaScript function. This example uses an `ActionIcon` and `Tooltip` that respond to the copied state.\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.CustomCopyButton(\n    value=\"Custom Copy demo\",\n    children={\"function\": \"copyActionIcon\"},\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\nvar dmc = window.dash_mantine_components;\nvar DashIconify = window.dash_iconify.DashIconify;\n\ndmcfuncs.copyActionIcon = function({ copied, copy }) {\n  return React.createElement(\n    dmc.Tooltip,\n    {\n      label: copied ? 'Copied' : 'Copy',\n      withArrow: true,\n      position: 'right'\n    },\n    React.createElement(\n      dmc.ActionIcon,\n      {\n        color: copied ? 'teal' : 'gray',\n        variant: 'subtle',\n        onClick: copy\n      },\n      copied\n        ? React.createElement(DashIconify, { icon: 'tabler:check', style: { width: 16, height: 16 } })\n        : React.createElement(DashIconify, { icon: 'tabler:copy', style: { width: 16, height: 16 } })\n    )\n  );\n};\n```\n\n\n\n### Security\nDue to security reasons `CopyButton` components will not work in iframes and may not work with local files opened with `file://` protocol.  \n\nIt will work with local websites using `http://` protocol, but when deployed it must use `https//` (secure).\n\nLearn more about [navigator.clipboard](https://web.dev/articles/async-clipboard).\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n#### CopyButton Selectors\n\n| Selector | Static selector          | Description                                        |\n|----------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| root     | .mantine-Button-root      | Root element                                       |\n| loader   | .mantine-Button-loader    | Loader component, displayed only when `loading` prop is set |\n| inner    | .mantine-Button-inner     | Contains all other elements, child of the root element |\n| section  | .mantine-Button-section   | Left and right sections of the button             |\n| label    | .mantine-Button-label     | Button children                                   |\n\n#### CopyButton CSS Variables\n\n| Selector | Variable                  | Description                                       |\n|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| root     | --button-bg               | Controls background                               |\n|          | --button-bd               | Controls border                                   |\n|          | --button-hover            | Controls background when hovered                 |\n|          | --button-color            | Controls text color                               |\n|          | --button-hover-color      | Controls text color when hovered                 |\n|          | --button-radius           | Controls border-radius                            |\n|          | --button-height           | Controls height of the button                     |\n|          | --button-padding-x        | Controls horizontal padding of the button         |\n|          | --button-fz               | Controls font-size of the button                  |\n|          | --button-justify          | Controls `justify-content` of the inner element   |\n\n#### CopyButton Data Attributes\n\n| Selector       | Attribute             | Condition               | Value                           |\n|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| root           | data-disabled          | `disabled` prop is set   | –                               |\n| root           | data-block             | `fullWidth` prop is set  | –                               |\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### CopyButton\n\n- children (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):\n    Button content displayed before copying.\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

    "category": "Charts",
    "content": "\n\n## AreaChart  \nArea chart component with stacked, percent and split variants.  \nCategory: Charts  \n\n### Introduction\n\nUse `AreaChart` component without `type` prop to render a regular area chart. In a regular area chart, each data series\nis plotted on its own and does not interact with other series.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ndmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    series = [\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"}\n    ],\n    curveType=\"linear\",\n    tickLine=\"xy\",\n    withGradient=False,\n    withXAxis=False,\n    withDots=False,\n)\n```\n\n### Data\nHere is the data imported for the examples on this page:\n\n```python\n\ndata = [\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 22\", \"Apples\": 2890, \"Oranges\": 2338, \"Tomatoes\": 2452},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 23\", \"Apples\": 2756, \"Oranges\": 2103, \"Tomatoes\": 2402},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 24\", \"Apples\": 3322, \"Oranges\": 986, \"Tomatoes\": 1821},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 25\", \"Apples\": 3470, \"Oranges\": 2108, \"Tomatoes\": 2809},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 26\", \"Apples\": 3129, \"Oranges\": 1726, \"Tomatoes\": 2290}\n]\n```\n\n### Stacked area chart\nSet type=\"stacked\" to render a stacked area chart. In this type of area chart stacking is applied along the vertical\naxis, allowing you to see the overall trend as well as the contribution of each individual series to the total.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Percent area chart\nSet type=\"percent\" to render a percent area chart. In this type of area chart the y-axis scale is always normalized to\n100%, making it easier to compare the contribution of each series in terms of percentages.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"percent\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Split area chart \nSet type=\"split\" to render a split area chart. In this type of area chart fill color is split into two colors, one for\npositive values and one for negative values. Split area chart supports only one data series.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 22\", \"Apples\": 110},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 23\", \"Apples\": 60},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 24\", \"Apples\": -80},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 25\", \"Apples\": 40},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 26\", \"Apples\": -40},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 27\", \"Apples\": 80},\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"split\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Split colors\nSet `splitColors` prop to an array of two colors to customize the fill color of split area chart. The first color is\nused for positive values and the second color for negative values. `splitColors` prop is ignored in other types of area charts.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 22\", \"Apples\": 110},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 23\", \"Apples\": 60},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 24\", \"Apples\": -80},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 25\", \"Apples\": 40},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 26\", \"Apples\": -40},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 27\", \"Apples\": 80},\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"split\",\n    strokeWidth=1,\n    activeDotProps={\"r\": 2, \"strokeWidth\": 1},\n    series=[{\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"bright\"}],\n    splitColors=[\"violet\", \"orange\"],\n)\n```\n### Legend\nTo display chart legend, set `withLegend` prop. When one of the items in the legend is hovered, the corresponding data\nseries is highlighted in the chart.Tooltip\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    withLegend=True,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Legend position\nYou can pass props down to recharts Legend component with `legendProps` prop. For example, setting the following will\nrender the legend at the bottom of the chart and set its height to 50px:\n```python\nlegendProps={'verticalAlign': 'bottom', 'height': 50} \n```\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    withLegend=True,\n    legendProps={\"verticalAlign\": \"bottom\", \"height\": 50},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Series labels\nBy default, series `name` is used as a label. To change it, set `label` property in `series` object:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    withLegend=True,\n    legendProps={\"verticalAlign\": \"bottom\"},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"label\": \"Apples sales\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"label\": \"Oranges sales\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"label\": \"Tomatoes sales\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Connect nulls\nUse `connectNulls` prop to specify whether to connect a data point across null points. By default, `connectNulls` is true.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 22\", \"Apples\": 110},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 23\", \"Apples\": 60},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 24\", \"Apples\": -80},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 25\", \"Apples\": 40},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 26\", \"Apples\": None},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 27\", \"Apples\": 80}\n]\n\ndmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    connectNulls=True,\n    series=[{\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"}],\n    curveType=\"linear\",\n)\n\n```\n### X and Y axis props\nUse `xAxisProps` and `yAxisProps` to pass props down to recharts `XAxis` and `YAxis` components. For example, these props can\nbe used to change orientation of axis:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    tickLine=\"xy\",\n    yAxisProps={\"tickMargin\": 15, \"orientation\": \"right\"},\n    xAxisProps={\"tickMargin\": 15, \"orientation\": \"top\"},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Axis labels\nUse `xAxisLabel` and `yAxisLabel` props to display axis labels:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    xAxisLabel=\"Date\",\n    yAxisLabel=\"Amount\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### X axis offset\nUse xAxisProps to set padding between the charts ends and the x-axis:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    xAxisProps={\"padding\": {\"left\": 30, \"right\": 30}},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Y axis scale\nUse `yAxisProps` to change domain of the Y axis. For example, if you know that your data will always be in the range\nof 0 to 100, you can set domain to [0, 100]:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 22\", \"Apples\": 50},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 23\", \"Apples\": 60},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 24\", \"Apples\": 40},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 25\", \"Apples\": 30},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 26\", \"Apples\": 0},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 27\", \"Apples\": 20},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 28\", \"Apples\": 20},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 29\", \"Apples\": 10},\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    yAxisProps={\"domain\": [0, 100]},\n    data=data,\n    connectNulls=True,\n    series=[{\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"}],\n)\n```\n### Right Y axis\n\nTo display additional Y axis on the right side of the chart, set `withRightYAxis` prop. You can pass props down to\nrecharts `YAxis` component with `rightYAxisProps` prop and assign a label to the right Y axis with `rightYAxisLabel` prop.\nNote that you need to bind data series to the right Y axis by setting `yAxisId` in the series object.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = biaxial_data = [\n    {\"name\": \"Page A\", \"uv\": 4000, \"pv\": 2400},\n    {\"name\": \"Page B\", \"uv\": 3000, \"pv\": 1398},\n    {\"name\": \"Page C\", \"uv\": 2000, \"pv\": 9800},\n    {\"name\": \"Page D\", \"uv\": 2780, \"pv\": 3908},\n    {\"name\": \"Page E\", \"uv\": 1890, \"pv\": 4800},\n    {\"name\": \"Page F\", \"uv\": 2390, \"pv\": 3800},\n    {\"name\": \"Page G\", \"uv\": 3490, \"pv\": 4300},\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"name\",\n    withRightYAxis=True,\n    yAxisLabel=\"uv\",\n    rightYAxisLabel=\"pv\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"uv\", \"color\": \"pink.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"pv\", \"color\": \"cyan.6\", \"yAxisId\": \"right\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Rotate x-axis labels\nTo rotate x-axis labels, set `xAxisProps.angle` to a number of degrees to rotate:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    tickLine=\"xy\",\n    xAxisProps={\"angle\": -20},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Value formatter\nTo format values in the tooltip and axis ticks, use `valueFormatter` prop. It accepts a function that takes number `value`\nas an argument and returns formatted value:\n\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    tickLine=\"xy\",\n    valueFormatter={\"function\": \"formatNumberIntl\"},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.formatNumberIntl = (value) => {\n  return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US').format(value);\n};\n```\n\n\n### Area color\nYou can reference colors from theme the same way as in other components, for example, `blue`, `red.5`, `orange.7`, etc. \nAny valid CSS color value is also accepted.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 22\", \"Apples\": 110},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 23\", \"Apples\": 60},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 24\", \"Apples\": -80},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 25\", \"Apples\": 40},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 26\", \"Apples\": 60},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 27\", \"Apples\": 80}\n]\n\ndmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    withGradient=True,\n    series=[{\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"orange.7\"}],\n)\n\n```\n\n### Change area color depending on color scheme\nYou can use CSS variables in color property. Learn more in the Theming section under [Colors.](/colors#colors-in-light-and-dark-mode)\n\nExample of area that is dark orange in light mode and lime in dark mode:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    withGradient=True,\n    series=[{\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"var(--chart-color)\"}],\n)\n```\n\n```css\n:root {\n   --chart-color: var(--mantine-color-orange-8)\n}\n\n:root[data-mantine-color-scheme=\"dark\"] {\n  --chart-color: var(--mantine-color-lime-4);\n}\n```\n\n\n### Stroke dash array\nSet `strokeDasharray` prop to control the stroke dash array of the grid and cursor lines. The value represent the\nlengths of alternating dashes and gaps. For example, strokeDasharray=\"10 5\" will render a dashed line with 10px dashes\nand 5px gaps.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    strokeDasharray=\"15 15\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Grid and text colors\nUse `--chart-grid-color` and `--chart-text-color` to change colors of grid lines and text within the chart. \nWith CSS , you can change colors depending on color scheme.  Learn more in the Theming section under [Colors.](/colors#colors-in-light-and-dark-mode)\n\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    className=\"chart-grid-text-colors\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n\n```css\n\n.chart-grid-text-colors {\n  --chart-grid-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-5);\n  --chart-text-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-8);\n}\n\n[data-mantine-color-scheme='dark'] .chart-grid-text-colors {\n  --chart-grid-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-3);\n  --chart-text-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-2);\n}\n```\n\nIf your application has only one color scheme, you can use `gridColor` and `textColor` props instead of CSS variables:\n\n```python\ndmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    gridColor=\"gray.5\",\n    textColor = \"gray.9\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n\n### Tooltip animation\nBy default, tooltip animation is disabled. To enable it, set `tooltipAnimationDuration` prop to a number of\nmilliseconds to animate the tooltip position change.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    tooltipAnimationDuration=200,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Area animation\nBy default, the Recharts data animation is disabled. To enable and customize the animation, use `areaProps` to pass properties to the Recharts `Area` component.\n\n```python\nfrom random import randint\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Update Chart\", id=\"btn-areachart-animation\"),\n        dmc.AreaChart(\n            id=\"areachart-animation\",\n            h=300,\n            dataKey=\"date\",\n            data=[{}],\n            tooltipAnimationDuration=500,\n            areaProps={\n                \"isAnimationActive\": True,\n                \"animationDuration\": 500,\n                \"animationEasing\": \"ease-in-out\",\n                \"animationBegin\": 500,\n            },\n            series=[\n                {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n            ],\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"areachart-animation\", \"data\"), Input(\"btn-areachart-animation\", \"n_clicks\")\n)\ndef update(n):\n    return [\n        {\n            \"date\": \"Mar 22\",\n            \"Apples\": 2890,\n            \"Oranges\": 2338,\n            \"Tomatoes\": randint(1000, 4000),\n        },\n        {\n            \"date\": \"Mar 23\",\n            \"Apples\": 2756,\n            \"Oranges\": 2103,\n            \"Tomatoes\": randint(1000, 4000),\n        },\n        {\n            \"date\": \"Mar 24\",\n            \"Apples\": 3322,\n            \"Oranges\": 986,\n            \"Tomatoes\": randint(1000, 4000),\n        },\n        {\n            \"date\": \"Mar 25\",\n            \"Apples\": 3470,\n            \"Oranges\": 2108,\n            \"Tomatoes\": randint(1000, 4000),\n        },\n        {\n            \"date\": \"Mar 26\",\n            \"Apples\": 3129,\n            \"Oranges\": 1726,\n            \"Tomatoes\": randint(1000, 4000),\n        },\n    ]\n```\n### Units\nSet `unit` prop to render a unit label next to the y-axis ticks and tooltip values:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    unit=\"$\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Remove tooltip\nTo remove tooltip, set `withTooltip=False`. It also removes the cursor line and disables interactions with the chart.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    withTooltip=False,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Customize dots\nUse `dotProps` to pass props down to recharts dot in regular state and `activeDotProps` to pass props down to recharts dot in active state (when cursor is over the current series).\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    dotProps={\"r\": 6, \"strokeWidth\": 2, \"stroke\": \"#fff\"},\n    activeDotProps={\"r\": 8, \"strokeWidth\": 1, \"fill\": \"#fff\"},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Stroke width\nUse `strokeWidth` prop to control the stroke width of all areas:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ndmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"}\n    ],\n    strokeWidth=2,\n)\n\n```\n\n### Fill opacity\nUse `fillOpacity` prop to control the fill opacity of all areas:\n\n```python\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ndmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"}\n    ],\n    fillOpacity=\"0.2\",\n    withGradient=False,\n)\n```\n\n### Sync multiple AreaCharts\nYou can pass props down to recharts AreaChart component with `areaChartProps` prop. For example, setting the following \nwill sync tooltip of multiple `AreaChart` components with the same `syncId` prop.\n\n```python\nareaChartProps={\"syncId\": \"any-id\"}\n```\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.Text(\"Apples sales:\"),\n        dmc.AreaChart(\n            h=180,\n            dataKey=\"date\",\n            data=data,\n            series=[{\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"}],\n            areaChartProps={\"syncId\": \"groceries\"},\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(\"Tomatoes sales\"),\n        dmc.AreaChart(\n            h=180,\n            dataKey=\"date\",\n            data=data,\n            series=[{\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"}],\n            areaChartProps={\"syncId\": \"groceries\"},\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Vertical orientation\nSet orientation=\"vertical\" to render a vertical area chart:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    orientation=\"vertical\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Dashed area line\nSet `strokeDasharray` property in series to change line style to dashed:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    strokeWidth=1,\n    dotProps={\"r\": 2},\n    activeDotProps={\"r\": 3, \"strokeWidth\": 1},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\", \"strokeDasharray\": \"5 5\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Reference lines\nUse `referenceLines` prop to render reference lines. Reference lines are always rendered behind the chart.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 22\", \"Apples\": 50},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 23\", \"Apples\": 60},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 24\", \"Apples\": 40},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 25\", \"Apples\": 30},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 26\", \"Apples\": 0},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 27\", \"Apples\": 20},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 28\", \"Apples\": 20},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 29\", \"Apples\": 10},\n]\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    yAxisProps={\"domain\": [0, 100]},\n    referenceLines=[\n        {\"y\": 40, \"label\": \"Average sales\", \"color\": \"red.6\"},\n        {\"x\": \"Mar 25\", \"label\": \"Report out\"},\n    ],\n    series=[{\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"}],\n)\n```\n### clickData\nUse the `clickData` property in a callback to retrieve data from the most recent click event.\nTo get the name of the clicked series, use the `clickSeriesName` property.\n\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.AreaChart(\n            id=\"figure-areachart\",\n            h=300,\n            dataKey=\"date\",\n            data=data,\n            type=\"stacked\",\n            series=[\n                {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n            ],\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"clickdata-areachart1\"),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"clickdata-areachart2\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"clickdata-areachart1\", \"children\"),\n    Output(\"clickdata-areachart2\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"figure-areachart\", \"clickData\"),\n    Input(\"figure-areachart\", \"clickSeriesName\"),\n)\ndef update(data, name):\n    return f\"clickData:  {data}\", f\"clickSeriesName: {name}\"\n```\n### hoverData\nUse the `hoverData` property in a callback to retrieve data from the most recent hover event.\nTo get the name of the hovered series, use the `hoverSeriesName` property.\n\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.AreaChart(\n            id=\"figure-areachart-hover\",\n            h=300,\n            dataKey=\"date\",\n            data=data,\n            type=\"stacked\",\n            series=[\n                {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n            ],\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"hoverdata-areachart1\"),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"hoverdata-areachart2\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"hoverdata-areachart1\", \"children\"),\n    Output(\"hoverdata-areachart2\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"figure-areachart-hover\", \"hoverData\"),\n    Input(\"figure-areachart-hover\", \"hoverSeriesName\"),\n)\ndef update(data, name):\n    return f\"hoverData:  {data}\", f\"hoverSeriesName: {name}\"\n```\n### highlightHover\n\nSet `highlightHover=True` to highlight the series when hovered, mirroring the behavior of hovering over chart legend items.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.AreaChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n    highlightHover=True\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

In a regular bar chart, each data series is plotted on its own and does not interact with other series.  \nCategory: Charts  \n\n### Introduction\n\n```python\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ndmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"}\n    ],\n    tickLine=\"y\",\n    gridAxis=\"y\",\n    withXAxis=True,\n    withYAxis=True\n)\n\n```\n\n### Data\n\nHere is the data used in all the examples on this page:\n\n```python\ndata = [\n    {\"month\": \"January\", \"Smartphones\": 1200, \"Laptops\": 900, \"Tablets\": 200},\n    {\"month\": \"February\", \"Smartphones\": 1900, \"Laptops\": 1200, \"Tablets\": 400},\n    {\"month\": \"March\", \"Smartphones\": 400, \"Laptops\": 1000, \"Tablets\": 200},\n    {\"month\": \"April\", \"Smartphones\": 1000, \"Laptops\": 200, \"Tablets\": 800},\n    {\"month\": \"May\", \"Smartphones\": 800, \"Laptops\": 1400, \"Tablets\": 1200},\n    {\"month\": \"June\", \"Smartphones\": 750, \"Laptops\": 600, \"Tablets\": 1000}\n]\n```\n\n### Stacked bar chart\nSet type=\"stacked\" to render a stacked bar chart. In this type of bar chart stacking is applied along the vertical axis,\nallowing you to see the overall trend as well as the contribution of each individual series to the total.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Mixed stacked bar chart\n\nYou can control how series are stacked by setting `stackId` property in `series` dictionary:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\", \"stackId\": \"a\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\", \"stackId\": \"b\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\", \"stackId\": \"b\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Percent bar chart\nSet type=\"percent\" to render a percent bar chart. In this type of bar chart the y-axis scale is always normalized \nto 100%, making it easier to compare the contribution of each series in terms of percentages.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"percent\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Waterfall\n\nSet `type=\"waterfall\"` to render a waterfall bar chart. This chart type illustrates how an initial value is influenced\nby subsequent positive or negative values, with each bar starting where the previous one ended. Use the `color` prop\ninside data to color each bar individually. Note that the series color gets overwritten for this specific bar. Use the\n`standalone` prop inside data to decouple the bar from the flow.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n    {\"item\": \"TaxRate\", \"Effective tax rate in %\": 21, \"color\": \"blue\"},\n    {\"item\": \"Foreign inc.\", \"Effective tax rate in %\": -15.5, \"color\": \"teal\"},\n    {\"item\": \"Perm. diff.\", \"Effective tax rate in %\": -3, \"color\": \"teal\"},\n    {\"item\": \"Credits\", \"Effective tax rate in %\": -3, \"color\": \"teal\"},\n    {\"item\": \"Loss carryf.\", \"Effective tax rate in %\": -2, \"color\": \"teal\"},\n    {\"item\": \"Law changes\", \"Effective tax rate in %\": 2, \"color\": \"red\"},\n    {\"item\": \"Reven. adj.\", \"Effective tax rate in %\": 4, \"color\": \"red\"},\n    {\n        \"item\": \"ETR\",\n        \"Effective tax rate in %\": 3.5,\n        \"color\": \"blue\",\n        \"standalone\": True,\n    },\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"item\",\n    type=\"waterfall\",\n    series=[{\"name\": \"Effective tax rate in %\", \"color\": \"blue\"}],\n    withLegend=True,\n)\n```\n### SVG Pattern as bar fill\n\nYou can use SVG patterns as bar fill. To do so, set `fill` property in series object to a url of the SVG pattern.\n\nExample of using diagonal stripes and crosshatch patterns as bar fill:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, dcc\nfrom .data import data\n\n# Define patterns for custom colors\npattern_definitions = dcc.Markdown('''\n<svg>\n  <defs>\n    <pattern id=\"diagonalStripes\" patternUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\" width=\"6\" height=\"8\" patternTransform=\"rotate(45)\">\n      <rect width=\"2\" height=\"8\" fill=\"rgba(0, 128, 128, 0.7)\"></rect>\n    </pattern>\n    <pattern id=\"crosshatch\" patternUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\" width=\"8\" height=\"8\">\n      <path d=\"M 0 0 L 8 0 L 8 8 L 0 8 Z\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"rgba(75, 0, 130, 0.7)\" strokeWidth=\"1\"></path>\n      <path d=\"M 0 0 L 8 8\" stroke=\"rgba(75, 0, 130, 0.7)\" strokeWidth=\"1\"></path>\n      <path d=\"M 8 0 L 0 8\" stroke=\"rgba(75, 0, 130, 0.7)\" strokeWidth=\"1\"></path>\n    </pattern>\n  </defs>\n</svg>\n''', dangerously_allow_html=True)\n\ncomponent = html.Div([\n    pattern_definitions,\n    dmc.BarChart(\n        h=300,\n        dataKey=\"month\",\n        data=data,\n        type=\"stacked\",\n        series=[\n            {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"url(#crosshatch)\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"url(#diagonalStripes)\"},\n        ],\n    )\n])\n```\n### Bar color based on value\nUse `getBarColor` prop to assign color based on `value`. `getBarColor` function is called with two arguments: `value`\nand `series` object. It should return a color string (theme color reference or any valid CSS color value).\n\nNote that color returned by `getBarColor` does not impact colors of the legend and tooltip.\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n    {\"month\": \"January\", \"Smartphones\": 1200, \"Laptops\": 900, \"Tablets\": 200},\n    {\"month\": \"February\", \"Smartphones\": 1900, \"Laptops\": 1200, \"Tablets\": 400},\n    {\"month\": \"March\", \"Smartphones\": 400, \"Laptops\": 1000, \"Tablets\": 200},\n    {\"month\": \"April\", \"Smartphones\": 1000, \"Laptops\": 200, \"Tablets\": 800},\n    {\"month\": \"May\", \"Smartphones\": 800, \"Laptops\": 1400, \"Tablets\": 1200},\n    {\"month\": \"June\", \"Smartphones\": 750, \"Laptops\": 600, \"Tablets\": 1000},\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    series=[{\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"gray.6\"}],\n    getBarColor={\"function\": \"barColor\"}\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\n// Highlights bars with value > 700 in teal, others in red\ndmcfuncs.barColor = (value) => {\n  return value > 700 ? 'teal.8' : 'red.8';\n};\n```\n\n\n\n### Legend\nTo display chart legend, set `withLegend` prop. When one of the items in the legend is hovered, the corresponding data\nseries is highlighted in the chart.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    withLegend=True,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Legend position\nYou can pass props down to recharts `Legend` component with `legendProps` prop. For example, setting the following will\nrender the legend at the bottom of the chart and set its height to 50px.\n\n```python\nlegendProps={\"verticalAlign\": \"bottom\", \"height\": 50} \n```\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    withLegend=True,\n    legendProps={\"verticalAlign\": \"bottom\", \"height\": 50},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Series labels\nBy default, series `name` is used as a label. To change it, set `label` property in `series` object:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    withLegend=True,\n    legendProps={\"verticalAlign\": \"bottom\"},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"label\": \"Smartphones sales\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"label\": \"Laptops sales\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"label\": \"Tablets sales\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### X and Y axis props\nUse `xAxisProps` and `yAxisProps` to pass props down to recharts `XAxis` and `YAxis` components. For example, these\nprops can be used to change orientation of axis:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    tickLine=\"xy\",\n    yAxisProps={\"tickMargin\": 15, \"orientation\": \"right\"},\n    xAxisProps={\"tickMargin\": 15, \"orientation\": \"top\"},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Axis labels\nUse `xAxisLabel` and `yAxisLabel` props to display axis labels:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    xAxisLabel=\"Date\",\n    yAxisLabel=\"Amount\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### X axis offset\nUse `xAxisProps` to set padding between the charts ends and the x-axis:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    xAxisProps={\"padding\": {\"left\": 30, \"right\": 30}},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Y axis scale\nUse `yAxisProps` to change domain of the Y axis. For example, if you know that your data will always be in the range\nof 0 to 150, you can set domain to `[0, 150]`:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    yAxisProps={\"domain\": [0, 250]},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Value formatter\nTo format values in the tooltip and axis ticks, use `valueFormat` prop. It accepts a function that takes number `value`\nas an argument and returns formatted value:\n\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder.

Learn more in the Theming section under [Colors.](/colors#colors-in-light-and-dark-mode)\n\nExample of bar area color that is dark orange in light mode and lime in dark mode:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    series=[{\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"var(--chart-color)\"}],\n)\n```\n\n```css\n:root {\n   --chart-color: var(--mantine-color-orange-8)\n}\n\n:root[data-mantine-color-scheme=\"dark\"] {\n  --chart-color: var(--mantine-color-lime-4);\n}\n```\n\n\n### Bar props\nYou can pass props down to recharts [Bar](https://recharts.org/en-US/api/Bar) component with `barProps` prop. `barProps` accepts an object with rechart props.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    orientation=\"vertical\",\n    yAxisProps={\"width\": 80},\n    barProps={\"radius\": 50},\n    series=[{\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"}],\n)\n```\n### Bar animation\nBy default, the Recharts data animation is disabled. To enable and customize the animation, use `barProps` to pass properties to the Recharts `Bar` component.\n\n\n```python\nfrom random import randint\n\nimport dash\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Update Chart\", id=\"btn-barchart-animation\"),\n        dmc.BarChart(\n            id=\"barchart-animation\",\n            h=300,\n            dataKey=\"month\",\n            data=[{}],\n            type=\"stacked\",\n            barProps={\"isAnimationActive\": True},\n            series=[\n                {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n            ],\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"barchart-animation\", \"data\"), Input(\"btn-barchart-animation\", \"n_clicks\")\n)\ndef update(n):\n    if n and n > 0:\n        return [\n            {\n                \"month\": month,\n                \"Smartphones\": randint(50, 300),\n                \"Laptops\": randint(30, 200),\n                \"Tablets\": randint(20, 150),\n            }\n            for month in [\"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\", \"May\", \"June\"]\n        ]\n    return dash.no_update\n```\n### Stroke dash array\nSet `strokeDasharray` prop to control the stroke dash array of the grid and cursor lines. The value represent the lengths of alternating dashes and gaps. For example, strokeDasharray=\"10 5\" will render a dashed line with 10px dashes and 5px gaps.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    strokeDasharray=\"15 15\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Grid and text colors\nUse `--chart-grid-color` and `--chart-text-color` to change colors of grid lines and text within the chart. \nWith CSS , you can change colors depending on color scheme.  Learn more in the Theming section under [Colors.](/colors#colors-in-light-and-dark-mode)\n\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    className=\"chart-grid-text-colors\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n\n```css\n\n.chart-grid-text-colors {\n  --chart-grid-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-5);\n  --chart-text-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-8);\n}\n\n[data-mantine-color-scheme='dark'] .chart-grid-text-colors {\n  --chart-grid-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-3);\n  --chart-text-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-2);\n}\n```\n\nIf your application has only one color scheme, you can use `gridColor` and `textColor` props instead of CSS variables:\n\n```python\ndmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    gridColor=\"gray.5\",\n    textColor = \"gray.9\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n\n### Tooltip animation\nBy default, tooltip animation is disabled. To enable it, set `tooltipAnimationDuration` prop to a number of milliseconds to animate the tooltip position change.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    tooltipAnimationDuration=200,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Units\nSet `unit` prop to render a unit label next to the y-axis ticks and tooltip values:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    unit=\"$\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Remove tooltip\nTo remove tooltip, set `withTooltip=false`. It also removes the cursor line and disables interactions with the chart.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    withTooltip=False,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Custom tooltip\nUse the `tooltipProps` `content` prop to  to pass custom tooltip renderer to recharts Tooltip component.  For example:\n```python\n tooltipProps={'content': {'functon': 'myFunction'}}\n```\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"}\n    ],\n    tickLine=\"y\",\n    gridAxis=\"y\",\n    withXAxis=True,\n    withYAxis=True,\n    tooltipProps={\"content\":  {\"function\": \"chartTooltip\"}}\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\nvar dmc = window.dash_mantine_components;\n\ndmcfuncs.chartTooltip = ({ label, payload }) => {\n\n  if (!payload || payload.length === 0) return null;\n\n  return React.createElement(\n    dmc.Paper,\n    {\n      px: \"md\",\n      py: \"sm\",\n      withBorder: true,\n      shadow: \"md\",\n      radius: \"md\",\n    },\n    [\n      React.createElement(\n        dmc.Text,\n        {\n          key: \"tooltip-label\",\n          fw: 500,\n          mb: 5,\n        },\n        label\n      ),\n      ...payload.map((item, index) =>\n        React.createElement(\n          dmc.Text,\n          {\n            key: `item-${index}`,\n            c: item.color,\n            fz: \"sm\",\n          },\n          `${item.name}: ${item.value}`\n        )\n      ),\n    ]\n  );\n};\n```\n\n\n### Sync multiple BarCharts\nYou can pass props down to recharts [BarChart](https://recharts.org/en-US/api/BarChart) component with `barChartProps` \nprop. For example, setting  will sync tooltip of multiple BarChart components with the same `syncId` prop.\n\n```python\nbarChartProps={\"syncId\": \"any-id\"}\n```\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.Text(\"Smartphone sales:\"),\n        dmc.BarChart(\n            h=180,\n            dataKey=\"month\",\n            data=data,\n            series=[{\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"}],\n            barChartProps={\"syncId\": \"tech\"},\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(\"Laptop sales\"),\n        dmc.BarChart(\n            h=180,\n            dataKey=\"month\",\n            data=data,\n            series=[{\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"}],\n            barChartProps={\"syncId\": \"tech\"},\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Vertical orientation\nSet orientation=\"vertical\" to render a vertical bar chart:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    orientation=\"vertical\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Reference lines\n\nUse `referenceLines` prop to render reference lines. Reference lines are always rendered behind the chart.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    withTooltip=False,\n    referenceLines=[\n        {\n            \"y\": 130,\n            \"color\": \"red.5\",\n            \"label\": \"Profit reached\",\n            \"labelPosition\": \"insideTopRight\",\n        }\n    ],\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Bar value label\nTo display value above each bar, set `withBarValueLabel=True`:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    withBarValueLabel=True,\n    withLegend=True,\n    withTooltip=False,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n    valueFormatter={\"function\": \"formatNumberIntl\"},\n)\n```\n### Bar value label props\nYou can pass props down to [recharts LabelList](https://recharts.org/en-US/api/LabelList) component with `valueLabelProps` prop. \n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    withBarValueLabel=True,\n    valueLabelProps={\"position\": 'inside', \"fill\": 'white'},\n    withLegend=True,\n    withTooltip=False,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n    valueFormatter={\"function\": \"formatNumberIntl\"},\n)\n```\n### clickData\nUse the `clickData` property in a callback to retrieve data from the most recent click event.\nTo get the name of the clicked series, use the `clickSeriesName` property.\n\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n

    "content": "\n\n## BubbleChart  \nBubble Chart component  \nCategory: Charts  \n\n### Usage\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.BubbleChart(\n    gridColor=\"gray.5\",\n    textColor=\"gray.9\",\n    h=60,\n    data=data,\n    range=[16, 225],\n    label=\"Sales/hour\",\n    color=\"lime.6\",\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"hour\", \"y\": \"index\", \"z\": \"value\"}\n)\n```\n### Data\n\nHere is the data used in all the examples on this page:\n\n```python\ndata = [\n    {\"hour\": \"08:00\", \"index\": 1, \"value\": 150},\n    {\"hour\": \"10:00\", \"index\": 1, \"value\": 166},\n    {\"hour\": \"12:00\", \"index\": 1, \"value\": 170},\n    {\"hour\": \"14:00\", \"index\": 1, \"value\": 150},\n    {\"hour\": \"16:00\", \"index\": 1, \"value\": 200},\n    {\"hour\": \"18:00\", \"index\": 1, \"value\": 400},\n    {\"hour\": \"20:00\", \"index\": 1, \"value\": 100},\n    {\"hour\": \"22:00\", \"index\": 1, \"value\": 160},\n]\n```\n\n### Change color\n\nYou can reference colors from theme the same way as in other components, for example, `blue`, `red.5`, `orange.7`, etc. Any valid CSS color value is also accepted.\n\n### Change line color depending on color scheme\nYou can use CSS variables in color property. Learn more in the Theming section under [Colors.](/colors#colors-in-light-and-dark-mode)\n\nExample of line color that is dark orange in light mode and lime in dark mode:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BubbleChart(\n    h=60,\n    data=data,\n    range=[16, 225],\n    label=\"Sales/hour\",\n    color=\"var(--chart-color)\",\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"hour\", \"y\": \"index\", \"z\": \"value\"}\n)\n```\n\n```css\n:root {\n   --chart-color: var(--mantine-color-orange-8)\n}\n\n:root[data-mantine-color-scheme=\"dark\"] {\n  --chart-color: var(--mantine-color-lime-4);\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Grid and text colors\nUse `--chart-grid-color` and `--chart-text-color` to change colors of grid lines and text within the chart. \nWith CSS , you can change colors depending on color scheme.  Learn more in the Theming section under [Colors.](/colors#colors-in-light-and-dark-mode)\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BubbleChart(\n    h=60,\n    data=data,\n    range=[16, 225],\n    label=\"Sales/hour\",\n    className=\"chart-grid-text-colors\",\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"hour\", \"y\": \"index\", \"z\": \"value\"}\n)\n```\n\n```css\n\n.chart-grid-text-colors {\n  --chart-grid-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-5);\n  --chart-text-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-8);\n}\n\n[data-mantine-color-scheme='dark'] .chart-grid-text-colors {\n  --chart-grid-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-3);\n  --chart-text-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-2);\n}\n```\n\nIf your application has only one color scheme, you can use `gridColor` and `textColor` props instead of CSS variables:\n\n```python\ndmc.BubbleChart(\n    gridColor=\"gray.5\",\n    textColor=\"gray.9\",\n    h=60,\n    data=data,\n    range=[16, 225],\n    label=\"Sales/hour\",\n    color=\"lime.6\",\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"hour\", \"y\": \"index\", \"z\": \"value\"}\n)\n\n```\n\n\n\n### Value formatter\nTo format values in the tooltip and axis ticks, use `valueFormatter` prop. It accepts a function that takes number `value`\nas an argument and returns formatted value:\n\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BubbleChart(\n    h=60,\n    data=data,\n    range=[16, 225],\n    label=\"Sales/hour\",\n    color=\"lime.6\",\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"hour\", \"y\": \"index\", \"z\": \"value\"},\n    valueFormatter={\"function\": \"formatUsd\"},\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.formatUsd = function (value) {\n  return `${value.toFixed(2)} USD`;\n};\n```\n\n\n\n### Remove tooltip\nTo remove tooltip, set `withTooltip=False`. It also removes the cursor line and disables interactions with the chart.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.BubbleChart(\n    gridColor=\"gray.5\",\n    textColor=\"gray.9\",\n    h=60,\n    data=data,\n    range=[16, 225],\n    label=\"Sales/hour\",\n    color=\"lime.6\",\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"hour\", \"y\": \"index\", \"z\": \"value\"},\n    withTooltip=False\n)\n```\n### clickData \n\nUse the `clickData` property in a callback to retrieve data from the most recent click event. \n\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.BubbleChart(\n            id=\"figure-bubblechart\",\n            gridColor=\"gray.5\",\n            textColor=\"gray.9\",\n            h=60,\n            data=data,\n            range=[16, 225],\n            label=\"Sales/hour\",\n            color=\"lime.6\",\n            dataKey={\"x\": \"hour\", \"y\": \"index\", \"z\": \"value\"}\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"clickdata-bubblechart\"),\n\n    ]\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"clickdata-bubblechart\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"figure-bubblechart\", \"clickData\"),\n)\ndef update(data):\n    return f\"clickData:  {data}\"\n```\n### hoverData \n\nUse the `hoverData` property in a callback to retrieve data from the most recent hover event. \n\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.BubbleChart(\n            id=\"figure-bubblechart-hover\",\n            gridColor=\"gray.5\",\n            textColor=\"gray.9\",\n            h=60,\n            data=data,\n            range=[16, 225],\n            label=\"Sales/hour\",\n            color=\"lime.6\",\n            dataKey={\"x\": \"hour\", \"y\": \"index\", \"z\": \"value\"}\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"hoverdata-bubblechart\"),\n\n    ]\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"hoverdata-bubblechart\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"figure-bubblechart-hover\", \"hoverData\"),\n)\ndef update(data):\n    return f\"hoverData:  {data}\"\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element.

When one of the items in the legend is hovered, the corresponding data\nseries is highlighted in the chart.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    withLegend=True,\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\"},\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Legend position\nYou can pass props down to recharts `Legend` component with `legendProps` prop. For example, setting the following will\nrender the legend at the bottom of the chart and set its height to 50px.\n\n```python\nlegendProps={\"verticalAlign\": \"bottom\", \"height\": 50} \n```\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    withLegend=True,\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    legendProps={\"verticalAlign\": \"bottom\", \"height\": 50},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\"},\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Series labels\nBy default, series `name` is used as a label. To change it, set `label` property in `series` object:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    withLegend=True,\n    legendProps={\"verticalAlign\": \"bottom\"},\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    series=[\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Tomatoes\",\n            \"label\": \"Tomatoes sales\",\n            \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\",\n            \"type\": \"bar\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Apples\",\n            \"label\": \"Apples sales\",\n            \"color\": \"red.8\",\n            \"type\": \"line\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Oranges\",\n            \"label\": \"Oranges sales\",\n            \"color\": \"yellow.8\",\n            \"type\": \"area\",\n        },\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Points labels\n\nTo display labels on data points, set `withPointLabels=True`. This feature is supported only for Line and Area charts:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    withPointLabels=True,\n    withLegend=True,\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\"},\n    ]\n)\n```\n### X and Y axis props\nUse `xAxisProps` and `yAxisProps` to pass props down to recharts `XAxis` and `YAxis` components. For example, these\nprops can be used to change orientation of axis:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    tickLine=\"xy\",\n    yAxisProps={\"tickMargin\": 15, \"orientation\": \"right\"},\n    xAxisProps={\"tickMargin\": 15, \"orientation\": \"top\"},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\"},\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Axis labels\nUse `xAxisLabel` and `yAxisLabel` props to display axis labels:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    xAxisLabel=\"Date\",\n    yAxisLabel=\"Amount\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    xAxisLabel=\"Date\",\n    yAxisLabel=\"Amount\",\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\"},\n    ]\n)\n```\n### X axis offset\nUse `xAxisProps` to set padding between the charts ends and the x-axis:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    type=\"stacked\",\n    xAxisProps={\"padding\": {\"left\": 30, \"right\": 30}},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    xAxisProps={\"padding\": {\"left\": 30, \"right\": 30}},\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\"},\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Y axis scale\nUse `yAxisProps` to change domain of the Y axis. For example, if you know that your data will always be in the range\nof 0 to 150, you can set domain to `[0, 150]`:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 22\", \"Apples\": 50},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 23\", \"Apples\": 60},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 24\", \"Apples\": 40},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 25\", \"Apples\": 30},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 26\", \"Apples\": 0},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 27\", \"Apples\": 20},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 28\", \"Apples\": 20},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 29\", \"Apples\": 10},\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    yAxisProps={\"domain\": [0, 100]},\n    withLegend=True,\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Chart color\n\nYou can reference colors from theme the same way as in other components, for example, `blue`, `red.5`, `orange.7`, etc. Any valid CSS color value is also accepted.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    withLegend=True,\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"blue\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Change chart color depending on color scheme\nYou can use CSS variables in color property. Learn more in the Theming section under [Colors.](/colors#colors-in-light-and-dark-mode)\n\nExample of line color that is dark orange in light mode and lime in dark mode:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    series=[{\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"var(--chart-color)\", \"type\": \"line\" }],\n)\n```\n\n```css\n:root {\n   --chart-color: var(--mantine-color-orange-8)\n}\n\n:root[data-mantine-color-scheme=\"dark\"] {\n  --chart-color: var(--mantine-color-lime-4);\n}\n```\n\n\n### Stroke dash array\nSet `strokeDasharray` prop to control the stroke dash array of the grid and cursor lines. The value represent the lengths of alternating dashes and gaps. For example, strokeDasharray=\"10 5\" will render a dashed line with 10px dashes and 5px gaps.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    strokeDasharray=\"15 15\",\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\"},\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Grid and text colors\nUse `--chart-grid-color` and `--chart-text-color` to change colors of grid lines and text within the chart. \nWith CSS , you can change colors depending on color scheme.  Learn more in the Theming section under [Colors.](/colors#colors-in-light-and-dark-mode)\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    className=\"chart-grid-text-colors\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\"},\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n```css\n\n.chart-grid-text-colors {\n  --chart-grid-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-5);\n  --chart-text-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-8);\n}\n\n[data-mantine-color-scheme='dark'] .chart-grid-text-colors {\n  --chart-grid-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-3);\n  --chart-text-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-2);\n}\n```\n\nIf your application has only one color scheme, you can use `gridColor` and `textColor` props instead of CSS variables:\n\n```python\ndmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    gridColor=\"gray.5\",\n    textColor=\"gray.9\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\"},\n    ]\n)\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n### Tooltip animation\nBy default, tooltip animation is disabled. To enable it, set `tooltipAnimationDuration` prop to a number of milliseconds to animate the tooltip position change.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    tooltipAnimationDuration=200,\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\"},\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Value formatter\nTo format values in the tooltip and axis ticks, use `valueFormatter` prop. It accepts a function that takes number `value`\nas an argument and returns formatted value:\n\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    valueFormatter={\"function\": \"formatNumberIntl\"},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\"},\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.formatNumberIntl = (value) => {\n  return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US').format(value);\n};\n```\n\n\n### Units\nSet `unit` prop to render a unit label next to the y-axis ticks and tooltip values:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    unit=\"$\",\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\"},\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Remove tooltip\nTo remove tooltip, set `withTooltip=false`. It also removes the cursor line and disables interactions with the chart.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    withTooltip=False,\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\"},\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Custom tooltip\nUse the `tooltipProps` `content` prop to  to pass custom tooltip renderer to recharts Tooltip component.  For example:\n```python\n tooltipProps={'content': {'functon': 'myFunction'}}\n```\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder.

For example, setting the following will sync tooltip of multiple `CompositeChart` components\nwith the same `syncId` prop.\n\n```python \ncomposedChartProps={\"syncId\": \"any-id\"}\n```\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n\n        dmc.Text(\"Apples sales:\", mb=\"md\", pl=\"md\"),\n        dmc.CompositeChart(\n            h=180,\n            data=data,\n            dataKey=\"date\",\n            series=[{\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\", \"type\": \"area\"}],\n            composedChartProps={\"syncId\": \"groceries\"}\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(\"Tomatoes sales:\", mb=\"md\", pl=\"md\", mt=\"xl\"),\n        dmc.CompositeChart(\n            h=180,\n            data=data,\n            dataKey=\"date\",\n            series=[{\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"cyan.6\", \"type\": \"bar\"}],\n            composedChartProps={\"syncId\": \"groceries\"}\n        )\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Dashed lines\nSet `strokeDasharray` property in series to change line style to dashed:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    strokeWidth=1,\n    dotProps={\"r\": 2},\n    activeDotProps={\"r\": 3, \"strokeWidth\": 1},\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\", \"strokeDasharray\": \"5 5\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\", \"strokeDasharray\": \"5 5\"},\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Reference lines\n\nUse `referenceLines` prop to render reference lines. Reference lines are always rendered behind the chart.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    yAxisProps={\"domain\": [0, 100]},\n    referenceLines=[\n        {\"y\": 1200, \"label\": \"Average sales\", \"color\": \"red.6\"},\n        {\"x\": \"Mar 25\", \"label\": \"Report out\", \"color\": \"blue.7\"},\n    ],\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n    ]\n)\n```\n### clickData\nUse the `clickData` property in a callback to retrieve data from the most recent click event.\nTo get the name of the clicked series, use the `clickSeriesName` property.\n\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.CompositeChart(\n            id=\"figure-compositechart\",\n            h=300,\n            data=data,\n            dataKey=\"date\",\n            withLegend=True,\n            maxBarWidth=30,\n            series=[\n                {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\"},\n            ]\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"clickdata-compositechart1\"),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"clickdata-compositechart2\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"clickdata-compositechart1\", \"children\"),\n    Output(\"clickdata-compositechart2\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"figure-compositechart\", \"clickData\"),\n    Input(\"figure-compositechart\", \"clickSeriesName\"),\n)\ndef update(data, name):\n    return f\"clickData:  {data}\", f\"clickSeriesName: {name}\"\n```\n### hoverData\nUse the `hoverData` property in a callback to retrieve data from the most recent hover event.\nTo get the name of the hovered series, use the `hoverSeriesName` property.\n\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.CompositeChart(\n            id=\"figure-compositechart-hover\",\n            h=300,\n            data=data,\n            dataKey=\"date\",\n            withLegend=True,\n            maxBarWidth=30,\n            series=[\n                {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\"},\n            ]\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"hoverdata-compositechart1\"),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"hoverdata-compositechart2\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"hoverdata-compositechart1\", \"children\"),\n    Output(\"hoverdata-compositechart2\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"figure-compositechart-hover\", \"hoverData\"),\n    Input(\"figure-compositechart-hover\", \"hoverSeriesName\"),\n)\ndef update(data, name):\n    return f\"hoverData:  {data}\", f\"hoverSeriesName: {name}\"\n```\n### highlightHover\n\nSet `highlightHover=True` to highlight the series when hovered, mirroring the behavior of hovering over chart legend items.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.CompositeChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    withLegend=True,\n    maxBarWidth=30,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"rgba(18, 120, 255, 0.2)\", \"type\": \"bar\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"red.8\", \"type\": \"line\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"yellow.8\", \"type\": \"area\"},\n    ],\n    withTooltip=False,\n    highlightHover=True\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

    "content": "\n\n## DonutChart  \nDonut chart component  \nCategory: Charts  \n\n### Usage\n\n`DonutChart` is based on [PieChart recharts component](https://recharts.org/en-US/api/PieChart):\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.DonutChart(data=data)\n```\n### Data\n\nHere is the data imported for the examples on this page:\n\n```python\n\ndata = [\n  { \"name\": \"USA\", \"value\": 400, \"color\": \"indigo.6\" },\n  { \"name\": \"India\", \"value\": 300, \"color\": \"yellow.6\" },\n  { \"name\": \"Japan\", \"value\": 100, \"color\": \"teal.6\" },\n  { \"name\": \"Other\", \"value\": 200, \"color\": \"gray.6\" }\n]\n\n```\n    \n\n### Segments labels\n\nSet `withLabels` prop to display labels next to each segment:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ndmc.DonutChart(\n    data=data,   \n    withLabels=True,\n    withLabelsLine=True\n)\n```\n\n### Size and thickness \n\nSet `size` prop to control width and height of the chart. Note that if `withLabels` prop is set, the chart height is\nautomatically increased by 80px to make room for labels. You can override this behavior by setting `h` style prop.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ndmc.DonutChart(\n    data=data,\n    size=160,\n    thickness=30\n)\n```\n\n\n### Padding angle \n\nUse `paddingAngle` prop to control the space between segments:\n\n```python\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ndmc.DonutChart(\n    data=data,\n    paddingAngle=30,\n)\n```\n\n\n### Segment color\n\nYou can reference colors from theme the same way as in other components, for example, `blue`, `red.5`, `orange.7`, etc. \nAny valid CSS color value is also accepted.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n    {\"name\": \"USA\", \"value\": 400, \"color\": \"blue\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Other\", \"value\": 200, \"color\": \"gray.6\"},\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.DonutChart(data=data)\n```\n### Tooltip data source\n\nBy default, the tooltip displays data for all segments when hovered over any segment. To display data only for the hovered segment, set tooltipDataSource=\"segment\":\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        html.Div(\n            [\n                dmc.Text(\n                    \"Data only for hovered segment\", fz=\"xs\", mb=\"sm\", ta=\"center\"\n                ),\n                dmc.DonutChart(\n                    data=data,\n                    withTooltip=True,\n                    tooltipDataSource=\"segment\",\n                    mx=\"auto\",\n                ),\n            ]\n        ),\n        html.Div(\n            [\n                dmc.Text(\"Data only for all segments\", fz=\"xs\", mb=\"sm\", ta=\"center\"),\n                dmc.DonutChart(\n                    data=data,\n                    withTooltip=True,\n                    mx=\"auto\",\n                ),\n            ]\n        ),\n    ],\n    gap=50,\n)\n```\n### Without tooltip\n\nTo remove the tooltip, set `withTooltip=False`:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.DonutChart(data=data, withTooltip=False)\n```\n### Chart label\n\nTo display a label in the center of the chart, use `chartLabel` prop. It accepts a string or a number:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.DonutChart(data=data, chartLabel=\"Users by country\")\n```\n### Start and end angle\n\nUse `startAngle` and `endAngle` props to control the start and end angle of the chart. For example, to display a\nhalf-circle chart, set `startAngle=180` and `endAngle=0`:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.DonutChart(data=data, startAngle=180, endAngle=0)\n```\n### Segments stroke\n\nUse `strokeWidth` prop to control the width of the stroke around each segment.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ndmc.DonutChart(\n    data=data,\n    strokeWidth=1.8  \n)\n```\n\nTo change color of the stroke, use `strokeColor` prop. You can reference colors from theme the same way as in other\ncomponents, for example, `blue`, `red.5`, `orange.7`, etc. Any valid CSS color value is also accepted.\n\n```python\ndmc.DonutChart(\n    data=data,\n    strokeColor=\"red.5\"\n)\n```\n\nBy default, segments stroke color is the same as the background color of the body element\n(`--mantine-color-body` CSS variable). If you want to change it depending on the color scheme, define CSS variable\nand pass it to the `strokeColor` prop:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.DonutChart(data=data, strokeColor=\"var(--card-bg)\")\n```\n```css\n.root {\n  --card-bg: light-dark(var(--mantine-color-gray-1), var(--mantine-color-dark-5));\n\n  background-color: var(--card-bg);\n  padding: var(--mantine-spacing-md);\n  border-radius: var(--mantine-radius-md);\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### Donut animation\nBy default, the Recharts data animation is disabled. To enable and customize the animation, use `pieProps` to pass properties to the Recharts `Pie` component.\n\n\n```python\nfrom random import randint\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ndef get_data(values):\n    return [\n        {\"name\": \"A\", \"value\": values[0], \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"B\", \"value\": values[1], \"color\": \"yellow.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"C\", \"value\": values[2], \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"C\", \"value\": values[3], \"color\": \"gray.6\"},\n    ]\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Update Chart\", id=\"btn-donutchart-animation\", n_clicks=0, mb=\"md\"),\n        dmc.DonutChart(\n            id=\"donutchart-animation\",\n            data=get_data([100, 0, 0, 0]),\n            pieProps={\"isAnimationActive\": True},\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"donutchart-animation\", \"data\"),\n    Input(\"btn-donutchart-animation\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\ndef update(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return get_data([400, 300, 600, 100])\n    return get_data([100, 0, 0, 0])\n```\n### clickData\nUse the `clickData` property in a callback to retrieve data from the most recent click event. To get the name of the\nclicked series, use the `clickSeriesName` property.\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.DonutChart(id=\"figure-donutchart\", data=data, withTooltip=False),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"clickdata-donutchart1\"),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"clickdata-donutchart2\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"clickdata-donutchart1\", \"children\"),\n    Output(\"clickdata-donutchart2\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"figure-donutchart\", \"clickData\"),\n    Input(\"figure-donutchart\", \"clickSeriesName\"),\n)\ndef update(data, name):\n    return f\"clickData:  {data}\", f\"clickSeriesName: {name}\"\n```\n### hoverData\nUse the `hoverData` property in a callback to retrieve data from the most recent hover event. To get the name of the \nhovered series, use the `hoverSeriesName` property.\n\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.DonutChart(id=\"figure-donutchart-hover\", data=data, withTooltip=False),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"hoverdata-donutchart1\"),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"hoverdata-donutchart2\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"hoverdata-donutchart1\", \"children\"),\n    Output(\"hoverdata-donutchart2\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"figure-donutchart-hover\", \"hoverData\"),\n    Input(\"figure-donutchart-hover\", \"hoverSeriesName\"),\n)\ndef update(data, name):\n    return f\"hoverData:  {data}\", f\"hoverSeriesName: {name}\"\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

    "content": "\n\n## LineChart  \nLine chart component  \nCategory: Charts  \n\n### Introduction\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ndmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    series = [\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"}\n    ],\n    curveType=\"linear\",\n    tickLine=\"xy\",\n    withXAxis=False,\n    withDots=False,\n)\n```\n\n\n### Data\nHere is the data imported for the examples on this page:\n\n```python\n\ndata = [\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 22\", \"Apples\": 2890, \"Oranges\": 2338, \"Tomatoes\": 2452},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 23\", \"Apples\": 2756, \"Oranges\": 2103, \"Tomatoes\": 2402},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 24\", \"Apples\": 3322, \"Oranges\": 986, \"Tomatoes\": 1821},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 25\", \"Apples\": 3470, \"Oranges\": 2108, \"Tomatoes\": 2809},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 26\", \"Apples\": 3129, \"Oranges\": 1726, \"Tomatoes\": 2290}\n]\n```\n\n### Gradient type\nSet `type=\"gradient\"` to render a line chart with gradient fill. To customize gradient colors, use `gradientStops` prop.\nIt accepts an array of objects with `offset` and `color` properties. `offset` is a number between 0 and 100 that defines\nthe position of the color in the gradient, `color` is a reference to `theme.colors` or any valid CSS color.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ndata = [\n    {\"date\": \"Jan\", \"temperature\": -25},\n    {\"date\": \"Feb\", \"temperature\": -10},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar\", \"temperature\": 5},\n    {\"date\": \"Apr\", \"temperature\": 15},\n    {\"date\": \"May\", \"temperature\": 30},\n    {\"date\": \"Jun\", \"temperature\": 15},\n    {\"date\": \"Jul\", \"temperature\": 30},\n    {\"date\": \"Aug\", \"temperature\": 40},\n    {\"date\": \"Sep\", \"temperature\": 15},\n    {\"date\": \"Oct\", \"temperature\": 20},\n    {\"date\": \"Nov\", \"temperature\": 0},\n    {\"date\": \"Dec\", \"temperature\": -10},\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    series=[{\"name\": \"temperature\", \"label\": \"Avg. Temperature\"}],\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    type=\"gradient\",\n    valueFormatter={\"function\": \"celsiusLabel\"},\n    gradientStops=[\n        {\"offset\": 0, \"color\": \"red.6\"},\n        {\"offset\": 20, \"color\": \"orange.6\"},\n        {\"offset\": 40, \"color\": \"yellow.5\"},\n        {\"offset\": 70, \"color\": \"lime.5\"},\n        {\"offset\": 80, \"color\": \"cyan.5\"},\n        {\"offset\": 100, \"color\": \"blue.5\"},\n    ],\n    strokeWidth=5,\n    curveType=\"natural\",\n    yAxisProps={\"domain\": [-25, 40]},\n    p=\"lg\"\n)\n```\n### Value formatter\nTo format values in the tooltip and axis ticks, use `valueFormatter` prop. It accepts a function that takes number `value`\nas an argument and returns formatted value:\n\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    valueFormatter={\"function\": \"formatNumberIntl\"},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.formatNumberIntl = (value) => {\n  return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US').format(value);\n};\n```\n\n\n### Legend\nTo display chart legend, set `withLegend` prop. When one of the items in the legend is hovered, the corresponding data\nseries is highlighted in the chart.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    withLegend=True,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Legend position\nYou can pass props down to recharts Legend component with `legendProps` prop. For example, setting the following will\nrender the legend at the bottom of the chart and set its height to 50px:\n```python\nlegendProps={'verticalAlign': 'bottom', 'height': 50} \n```\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    withLegend=True,\n    legendProps={\"verticalAlign\": \"bottom\", \"height\": 50},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Series labels\nBy default, series `name` is used as a label. To change it, set `label` property in `series` object:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    withLegend=True,\n    legendProps={\"verticalAlign\": \"bottom\"},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"label\": \"Apples sales\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"label\": \"Oranges sales\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"label\": \"Tomatoes sales\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Connect nulls\nUse `connectNulls` prop to specify whether to connect a data point across null points. By default, `connectNulls` is true.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 22\", \"Apples\": 110},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 23\", \"Apples\": 60},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 24\", \"Apples\": -80},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 25\", \"Apples\": 40},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 26\", \"Apples\": None},\n  {\"date\": \"Mar 27\", \"Apples\": 80}\n]\n\ndmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    connectNulls=True,\n    series=[{\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"}],\n    curveType=\"linear\",\n)\n\n```\n\n### X and Y axis props\nUse `xAxisProps` and `yAxisProps` to pass props down to recharts `XAxis` and `YAxis` components. For example, these props can\nbe used to change orientation of axis:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    tickLine=\"xy\",\n    yAxisProps={\"tickMargin\": 15, \"orientation\": \"right\"},\n    xAxisProps={\"tickMargin\": 15, \"orientation\": \"top\"},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Axis labels\nUse `xAxisLabel` and `yAxisLabel` props to display axis labels:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    xAxisLabel=\"Date\",\n    yAxisLabel=\"Amount\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### X axis offset\nUse xAxisProps to set padding between the charts ends and the x-axis:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    xAxisProps={\"padding\": {\"left\": 30, \"right\": 30}},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Y axis scale\nUse `yAxisProps` to change domain of the Y axis. For example, if you know that your data will always be in the range\nof 0 to 100, you can set domain to `[0, 100]`:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 22\", \"Apples\": 50},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 23\", \"Apples\": 60},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 24\", \"Apples\": 40},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 25\", \"Apples\": 30},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 26\", \"Apples\": 0},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 27\", \"Apples\": 20},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 28\", \"Apples\": 20},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 29\", \"Apples\": 10},\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    yAxisProps={\"domain\": [0, 100]},\n    data=data,\n    connectNulls=True,\n    series=[{\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"}],\n)\n```\n### Right Y axis\nTo display additional Y axis on the right side of the chart, set `withRightYAxis` prop. You can pass props down to\nrecharts `YAxis` component with `rightYAxisProps` prop and assign a label to the right Y axis with `rightYAxisLabel` prop.\nNote that you need to bind data series to the right Y axis by setting `yAxisId` in the series object.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = biaxial_data = [\n    {\"name\": \"Page A\", \"uv\": 4000, \"pv\": 2400},\n    {\"name\": \"Page B\", \"uv\": 3000, \"pv\": 1398},\n    {\"name\": \"Page C\", \"uv\": 2000, \"pv\": 9800},\n    {\"name\": \"Page D\", \"uv\": 2780, \"pv\": 3908},\n    {\"name\": \"Page E\", \"uv\": 1890, \"pv\": 4800},\n    {\"name\": \"Page F\", \"uv\": 2390, \"pv\": 3800},\n    {\"name\": \"Page G\", \"uv\": 3490, \"pv\": 4300},\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"name\",\n    withRightYAxis=True,\n    yAxisLabel=\"uv\",\n    rightYAxisLabel=\"pv\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"uv\", \"color\": \"pink.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"pv\", \"color\": \"cyan.6\", \"yAxisId\": \"right\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Rotate x-axis labels\nTo rotate x-axis labels, set `xAxisProps.angle` to a number of degrees to rotate:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    tickLine=\"xy\",\n    xAxisProps={\"angle\": -20},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Line color\nYou can reference colors from theme the same way as in other components, for example, `blue`, `red.5`, `orange.7`, etc. \nAny valid CSS color value is also accepted.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    series=[{\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"orange.7\"}],\n)\n```\n### Change line color depending on color scheme\nYou can use CSS variables in color property. Learn more in the Theming section under [Colors.](/colors#colors-in-light-and-dark-mode)\n\nExample of line color that is dark orange in light mode and lime in dark mode:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    series=[{\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"var(--chart-color)\"}],\n)\n```\n\n```css\n:root {\n   --chart-color: var(--mantine-color-orange-8)\n}\n\n:root[data-mantine-color-scheme=\"dark\"] {\n  --chart-color: var(--mantine-color-lime-4);\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Stroke dash array\nSet `strokeDasharray` prop to control the stroke dash array of the grid and cursor lines. The value represent the\nlengths of alternating dashes and gaps. For example, strokeDasharray=\"10 5\" will render a dashed line with 10px dashes\nand 5px gaps.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    strokeDasharray=\"15 15\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Grid and text colors\nUse `--chart-grid-color` and `--chart-text-color` to change colors of grid lines and text within the chart. \nWith CSS , you can change colors depending on color scheme.  Learn more in the Theming section under [Colors.](/colors#colors-in-light-and-dark-mode)\n\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    className=\"chart-grid-text-colors\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n\n```css\n\n.chart-grid-text-colors {\n  --chart-grid-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-5);\n  --chart-text-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-8);\n}\n\n[data-mantine-color-scheme='dark'] .chart-grid-text-colors {\n  --chart-grid-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-3);\n  --chart-text-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-2);\n}\n```\n\nIf your application has only one color scheme, you can use `gridColor` and `textColor` props instead of CSS variables:\n\n```python\ndmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    gridColor=\"gray.5\",\n    textColor = \"gray.9\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n\n```\n\n### Tooltip animation\nBy default, tooltip animation is disabled. To enable it, set `tooltipAnimationDuration` prop to a number of\nmilliseconds to animate the tooltip position change.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    tooltipAnimationDuration=200,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Line animation\nBy default, the Recharts data animation is disabled. To enable and customize the animation, use `lineProps` to pass properties to the Recharts `Line` component.\n\n```python\nfrom random import randint\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Update Chart\", id=\"btn-linechart-animation\"),\n        dmc.LineChart(\n            id=\"linechart-animation\",\n            h=300,\n            dataKey=\"date\",\n            data=[{}],\n            tooltipAnimationDuration=500,\n            lineProps={\n                \"isAnimationActive\": True,\n                \"animationDuration\": 500,\n                \"animationEasing\": \"ease-in-out\",\n                \"animationBegin\": 500,\n            },\n            series=[\n                {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n            ],\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"linechart-animation\", \"data\"), Input(\"btn-linechart-animation\", \"n_clicks\")\n)\ndef update(n):\n    return [\n        {\n            \"date\": \"Mar 22\",\n            \"Apples\": 2890,\n            \"Oranges\": 2338,\n            \"Tomatoes\": randint(1000, 4000),\n        },\n        {\n            \"date\": \"Mar 23\",\n            \"Apples\": 2756,\n            \"Oranges\": 2103,\n            \"Tomatoes\": randint(1000, 4000),\n        },\n        {\n            \"date\": \"Mar 24\",\n            \"Apples\": 3322,\n            \"Oranges\": 986,\n            \"Tomatoes\": randint(1000, 4000),\n        },\n        {\n            \"date\": \"Mar 25\",\n            \"Apples\": 3470,\n            \"Oranges\": 2108,\n            \"Tomatoes\": randint(1000, 4000),\n        },\n        {\n            \"date\": \"Mar 26\",\n            \"Apples\": 3129,\n            \"Oranges\": 1726,\n            \"Tomatoes\": randint(1000, 4000),\n        },\n    ]\n```\n### Units\nSet `unit` prop to render a unit label next to the y-axis ticks and tooltip values:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    unit=\"$\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Remove tooltip\nTo remove tooltip, set `withTooltip=False`. It also removes the cursor line and disables interactions with the chart.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    withTooltip=False,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Custom tooltip\nUse the `tooltipProps` `content` prop to  to pass custom tooltip renderer to recharts Tooltip component.  For example:\n```python\n tooltipProps={'content': {'functon': 'myFunction'}}\n```\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder.

For example, setting the following \nwill sync tooltip of multiple `LineChart` components with the same `syncId` prop.\n\n```python\nlineChartProps={\"syncId\": \"any-id\"}\n```\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.Text(\"Apples sales:\"),\n        dmc.LineChart(\n            h=180,\n            dataKey=\"date\",\n            data=data,\n            series=[{\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"}],\n            lineChartProps={\"syncId\": \"groceries\"},\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(\"Tomatoes sales\"),\n        dmc.LineChart(\n            h=180,\n            dataKey=\"date\",\n            data=data,\n            series=[{\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"}],\n            lineChartProps={\"syncId\": \"groceries\"},\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Vertical orientation\nSet orientation=\"vertical\" to render a vertical area chart:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    orientation=\"vertical\",\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Dashed area line\nSet `strokeDasharray` property in series to change line style to dashed:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    strokeWidth=1,\n    dotProps={\"r\": 2},\n    activeDotProps={\"r\": 3, \"strokeWidth\": 1},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\", \"strokeDasharray\": \"5 5\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Reference lines\nUse `referenceLines` prop to render reference lines. Reference lines are always rendered behind the chart.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 22\", \"Apples\": 50},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 23\", \"Apples\": 60},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 24\", \"Apples\": 40},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 25\", \"Apples\": 30},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 26\", \"Apples\": 0},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 27\", \"Apples\": 20},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 28\", \"Apples\": 20},\n    {\"date\": \"Mar 29\", \"Apples\": 10},\n]\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    yAxisProps={\"domain\": [0, 100]},\n    referenceLines=[\n        {\"y\": 40, \"label\": \"Average sales\", \"color\": \"red.6\"},\n        {\"x\": \"Mar 25\", \"label\": \"Report out\"},\n    ],\n    series=[{\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"}],\n)\n```\n### clickData\nUse the `clickData` property in a callback to retrieve data from the most recent click event.\nTo get the name of the clicked series, use the `clickSeriesName` property.\n\nNote: To enable `clickSeriesName` when clicking on the dots,  set `withTooltip=True`.\n\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.LineChart(\n            id=\"figure-linechart\",\n            h=300,\n            dataKey=\"date\",\n            data=data,\n            withLegend=True,\n            series=[\n                {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n            ],\n            activeDotProps={\"r\": 8, \"strokeWidth\": 1, \"fill\": \"#fff\"},\n            strokeWidth=4\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"clickdata-linechart1\"),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"clickdata-linechart2\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"clickdata-linechart1\", \"children\"),\n    Output(\"clickdata-linechart2\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"figure-linechart\", \"clickData\"),\n    Input(\"figure-linechart\", \"clickSeriesName\"),\n)\ndef update(data, name):\n    return f\"clickData:  {data}\", f\"clickSeriesName: {name}\"\n```\n### hoverData\nUse the `hoverData` property in a callback to retrieve data from the most recent hover event.\nTo get the name of the hovered series, use the `hoverSeriesName` property.\n\nNote: To enable `hoverSeriesName` when hovering on the dots,  set `withTooltip=True`.\n\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.LineChart(\n            id=\"figure-linechart-hover\",\n            h=300,\n            dataKey=\"date\",\n            data=data,\n            series=[\n                {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n                {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n            ],\n            activeDotProps={\"r\": 8, \"strokeWidth\": 1, \"fill\": \"#fff\"},\n            strokeWidth=4\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"hoverdata-linechart1\"),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"hoverdata-linechart2\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"hoverdata-linechart1\", \"children\"),\n    Output(\"hoverdata-linechart2\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"figure-linechart-hover\", \"hoverData\"),\n    Input(\"figure-linechart-hover\", \"hoverSeriesName\"),\n)\ndef update(data, name):\n    return f\"hoverData:  {data}\", f\"hoverSeriesName: {name}\"\n```\n### highlightHover\n\nSet `highlightHover=True` to highlight the series when hovered, mirroring the behavior of hovering over chart legend items.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.LineChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"date\",\n    data=data,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Apples\", \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Oranges\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tomatoes\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n    withLegend=True,\n    highlightHover=True,\n    withTooltip=False,\n    strokeWidth=4\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

Use `labelPosition` prop to control the position of labels\nrelative to the corresponding segment. Note that if your chart has a lot of segments and labelPosition=\"inside\" is\nset, labels might overlap. In this case, use labelPosition=\"outside\".\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ndmc.PieChart(\n    data=data,\n    withLabelsLine=True,\n    labelsPosition=\"inside\",\n    labelsType=\"percent\",\n    withLabels=True,\n)\n```\n\n### Size\n\nSet `size` prop to control width and height of the chart. Note that if `withLabels` and labelPosition=\"outside\" prop\nare set, the chart height is automatically increased by 80px to make room for labels. You can override this behavior\nby setting `h` and `w` style prop.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ndmc.PieChart(\n    data=data,\n    size=275  \n)\n```\n### Segment color\n\nYou can reference colors from theme the same way as in other components, for example, `blue`, `red.5`, `orange.7`, etc. \nAny valid CSS color value is also accepted.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n    {\"name\": \"USA\", \"value\": 400, \"color\": \"blue\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Other\", \"value\": 200, \"color\": \"gray.6\"},\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.PieChart(data=data)\n```\n### Enable Tooltip\n\nTo enable the tooltip, set `withTooltip` prop:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.PieChart(data=data, withTooltip=True)\n```\n### Tooltip data source\n\nBy default, the tooltip displays data for all segments when hovered over any segment. To display data only for the hovered segment, set tooltipDataSource=\"segment\":\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        html.Div(\n            [\n                dmc.Text(\n                    \"Data only for hovered segment\", fz=\"xs\", mb=\"sm\", ta=\"center\"\n                ),\n                dmc.PieChart(\n                    data=data,\n                    withTooltip=True,\n                    tooltipDataSource=\"segment\",\n                    mx=\"auto\",\n                ),\n            ]\n        ),\n        html.Div(\n            [\n                dmc.Text(\"Data only for all segments\", fz=\"xs\", mb=\"sm\", ta=\"center\"),\n                dmc.PieChart(\n                    data=data,\n                    withTooltip=True,\n                    mx=\"auto\",\n                ),\n            ]\n        ),\n    ],\n    gap=50,\n)\n```\n### Start and end angle\n\nUse `startAngle` and `endAngle` props to control the start and end angle of the chart. For example, to display a\nhalf-circle chart, set `startAngle=180` and `endAngle=0`:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.PieChart(data=data, startAngle=180, endAngle=0)\n```\n### Segments stroke\n\nUse `strokeWidth` prop to control the width of the stroke around each segment.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ndmc.PieChart(\n    data=data,\n    strokeWidth=1\n)\n```\n\nTo change color of the stroke, use `strokeColor` prop. You can reference colors from theme the same way as in other\ncomponents, for example, `blue`, `red.5`, `orange.7`, etc. Any valid CSS color value is also accepted.\n\n```python\ndmc.PieChart(\n    data=data,\n    strokeWidth=1.8,\n    strokeColor=\"red.5\"\n)\n```\n\nBy default, segments stroke color is the same as the background color of the body element\n(`--mantine-color-body` CSS variable). If you want to change it depending on the color scheme, define CSS variable\nand pass it to the `strokeColor` prop:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.PieChart(data=data, strokeColor=\"var(--card-bg)\")\n```\n```css\n.root {\n  --card-bg: light-dark(var(--mantine-color-gray-1), var(--mantine-color-dark-5));\n\n  background-color: var(--card-bg);\n  padding: var(--mantine-spacing-md);\n  border-radius: var(--mantine-radius-md);\n}\n\n```\n\n\n\n### Pie animation\nBy default, the Recharts data animation is disabled. To enable and customize the animation, use `pieProps` to pass properties to the Recharts `Pie` component.\n\n\n```python\nfrom random import randint\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ndef get_data(values):\n    return [\n        {\"name\": \"A\", \"value\": values[0], \"color\": \"indigo.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"B\", \"value\": values[1], \"color\": \"yellow.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"C\", \"value\": values[2], \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"C\", \"value\": values[3], \"color\": \"gray.6\"},\n    ]\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Update Chart\", id=\"btn-piechart-animation\", n_clicks=0, mb=\"md\"),\n        dmc.PieChart(\n            id=\"piechart-animation\",\n            data=get_data([100, 0, 0, 0]),\n            pieProps={\"isAnimationActive\": True},\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"piechart-animation\", \"data\"), Input(\"btn-piechart-animation\", \"n_clicks\")\n)\ndef update(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return get_data([400, 300, 600, 100])\n    return get_data([100, 0, 0, 0])\n```\n### clickData\nUse the `clickData` property in a callback to retrieve data from the most recent click event. To get the name of the\nclicked series, use the `clickSeriesName` property.\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.PieChart(\n            id=\"figure-piechart\",\n            data=data,\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"clickdata-piechart1\"),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"clickdata-piechart2\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"clickdata-piechart1\", \"children\"),\n    Output(\"clickdata-piechart2\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"figure-piechart\", \"clickData\"),\n    Input(\"figure-piechart\", \"clickSeriesName\"),\n)\ndef update(data, name):\n    return f\"clickData:  {data}\", f\"clickSeriesName: {name}\"\n```\n### hoverData\nUse the `hoverData` property in a callback to retrieve data from the most recent hover event. To get the name of the \nhovered series, use the `hoverSeriesName` property.\n\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.PieChart(\n            id=\"figure-piechart-hover\",\n            data=data,\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"hoverdata-piechart1\"),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"hoverdata-piechart2\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"hoverdata-piechart1\", \"children\"),\n    Output(\"hoverdata-piechart2\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"figure-piechart-hover\", \"hoverData\"),\n    Input(\"figure-piechart-hover\", \"hoverSeriesName\"),\n)\ndef update(data, name):\n    return f\"hoverData:  {data}\", f\"hoverSeriesName: {name}\"\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

component:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n    {\"product\": \"Apples\", \"sales\": 120},\n    {\"product\": \"Oranges\", \"sales\": 98},\n    {\"product\": \"Tomatoes\", \"sales\": 86},\n    {\"product\": \"Grapes\", \"sales\": 99},\n    {\"product\": \"Bananas\", \"sales\": 85},\n    {\"product\": \"Lemons\", \"sales\": 65},\n]\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.RadarChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"product\",\n    withPolarRadiusAxis=True,\n    series=[{\"name\": \"sales\", \"color\": \"blue.4\", \"opacity\": 0.2}],\n)\n```\n### Multiple series \n\nYou can display multiple series on the same radar chart:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n    {\"product\": \"Apples\", \"sales_january\": 120, \"sales_february\": 100},\n    {\"product\": \"Oranges\", \"sales_january\": 98, \"sales_february\": 90},\n    {\"product\": \"Tomatoes\", \"sales_january\": 86, \"sales_february\": 70},\n    {\"product\": \"Grapes\", \"sales_january\": 99, \"sales_february\": 80},\n    {\"product\": \"Bananas\", \"sales_january\": 85, \"sales_february\": 120},\n    {\"product\": \"Lemons\", \"sales_january\": 65, \"sales_february\": 150},\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.RadarChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"product\",\n    withPolarRadiusAxis=True,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"sales_january\", \"color\": \"lime.4\", \"opacity\": 0.1},\n        {\"name\": \"sales_february\", \"color\": \"cyan.4\", \"opacity\": 0.1},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Change Color\n\nYou can reference colors from theme the same way as in other components, for example, `blue`, `red.5`, `orange.7`, etc. Any valid CSS color value is also accepted.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n    {\"product\": \"Apples\", \"sales\": 120},\n    {\"product\": \"Oranges\", \"sales\": 98},\n    {\"product\": \"Tomatoes\", \"sales\": 86},\n    {\"product\": \"Grapes\", \"sales\": 99},\n    {\"product\": \"Bananas\", \"sales\": 85},\n    {\"product\": \"Lemons\", \"sales\": 65},\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.RadarChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"product\",\n    series=[{\"name\": \"sales\", \"color\": \"green\", \"strokeColor\": \"blue\"}],\n)\n```\n### Hide/show chart parts\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n  {\"product\": \"Apples\", \"sales_january\": 120, \"sales_february\": 100},\n  {\"product\": \"Oranges\", \"sales_january\": 98, \"sales_february\": 90},\n  {\"product\": \"Tomatoes\", \"sales_january\": 86, \"sales_february\": 70},\n  {\"product\": \"Grapes\", \"sales_january\": 99, \"sales_february\": 80},\n  {\"product\": \"Bananas\", \"sales_january\": 85, \"sales_february\":

{\"name\": \"sales_january\", \"color\": \"lime.4\", \"opacity\": 0.1},\n      {\"name\": \"sales_february\", \"color\": \"cyan.4\", \"opacity\": 0.1}\n    ],\n    withPolarGrid=True,\n    withPolarAngleAxis=False,\n    withPolarRadiusAxis=True,\n)\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Rechart props\n\nTo pass props down to the underlying recharts components, use the following props:\n- `radarProps` passed props to [RadarChart](https://recharts.org/en-US/api/RadarChart) component\n- `radarChartProps` passed props to [RadarChart](https://recharts.org/en-US/api/RadarChart) component\n- `polarGridProps` passed props to [PolarGrid](https://recharts.org/en-US/api/PolarGrid) component\n- `polarAngleAxisProps` passed props to [PolarAngleAxis](https://recharts.org/en-US/api/PolarAngleAxis) component\n- `polarRadiusAxisProps` passed props to [PolarRadiusAxis](https://recharts.org/en-US/api/PolarRadiusAxis) component\n\nExample of passing props down to PolarRadiusAxis component:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ndata = [\n    {\"product\": \"Apples\", \"sales_january\": 120, \"sales_february\": 100},\n    {\"product\": \"Oranges\", \"sales_january\": 98, \"sales_february\": 90},\n    {\"product\": \"Tomatoes\", \"sales_january\": 86, \"sales_february\": 70},\n    {\"product\": \"Grapes\", \"sales_january\": 99, \"sales_february\": 80},\n    {\"product\": \"Bananas\", \"sales_january\": 85, \"sales_february\": 120},\n    {\"product\": \"Lemons\", \"sales_january\": 65, \"sales_february\": 150},\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.RadarChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data,\n    dataKey=\"product\",\n    withPolarRadiusAxis=True,\n    polarRadiusAxisProps={\"angle\": 30},\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"sales_january\", \"color\": \"lime.4\", \"opacity\": 0.1},\n        {\"name\": \"sales_february\", \"color\": \"cyan.4\", \"opacity\": 0.1},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Radar animation\nBy default, the Recharts data animation is disabled. To enable and customize the animation, use `radarProps` to pass properties to the Recharts `Radar` component.\n\n\n```python\nfrom random import randint\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Update Chart\", id=\"btn-radarchart-animation\"),\n        dmc.RadarChart(\n            id=\"radarchart-animation\",\n            h=300,\n            data=[{}],\n            dataKey=\"product\",\n            withPolarRadiusAxis=True,\n            radarProps={\n                \"isAnimationActive\": True,\n            },\n            series=[{\"name\": \"sales\", \"color\": \"blue.4\", \"opacity\": 0.2}],\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"radarchart-animation\", \"data\"),\n    Input(\"btn-radarchart-animation\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\ndef update(n):\n    return [\n        {\"product\": \"Apples\", \"sales\": randint(20, 100)},\n        {\"product\": \"Oranges\", \"sales\": randint(20, 100)},\n        {\"product\": \"Tomatoes\", \"sales\": randint(20, 100)},\n        {\"product\": \"Grapes\", \"sales\": randint(20, 100)},\n        {\"product\": \"Bananas\", \"sales\": randint(20, 100)},\n        {\"product\": \"Lemons\", \"sales\": randint(20, 100)},\n    ]\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

A single series `data1` and a multiple series `data2`:\n\n```python\n\ndata1 = [\n    {\n        \"color\": \"blue.5\",\n        \"name\": \"Group 1\",\n        \"data\": [\n            {\"age\": 25, \"BMI\": 20},\n            {\"age\": 30, \"BMI\": 22},\n            {\"age\": 35, \"BMI\": 18},\n            {\"age\": 40, \"BMI\": 25},\n            {\"age\": 45, \"BMI\": 30},\n            {\"age\": 28, \"BMI\": 15},\n            {\"age\": 22, \"BMI\": 12},\n            {\"age\": 50, \"BMI\": 28},\n            {\"age\": 32, \"BMI\": 19},\n            {\"age\": 48, \"BMI\": 31},\n            {\"age\": 26, \"BMI\": 24},\n            {\"age\": 38, \"BMI\": 27},\n            {\"age\": 42, \"BMI\": 29},\n            {\"age\": 29, \"BMI\": 16},\n            {\"age\": 34, \"BMI\": 23},\n            {\"age\": 44, \"BMI\": 33},\n            {\"age\": 23, \"BMI\": 14},\n            {\"age\": 37, \"BMI\": 26},\n            {\"age\": 49, \"BMI\": 34},\n            {\"age\": 27, \"BMI\": 17},\n            {\"age\": 41, \"BMI\": 32},\n            {\"age\": 31, \"BMI\": 21},\n            {\"age\": 46, \"BMI\": 35},\n            {\"age\": 24, \"BMI\": 13},\n            {\"age\": 33, \"BMI\": 22},\n            {\"age\": 39, \"BMI\": 28},\n            {\"age\": 47, \"BMI\": 30},\n            {\"age\": 36, \"BMI\": 25},\n            {\"age\": 43, \"BMI\": 29},\n            {\"age\": 21, \"BMI\": 11}\n        ]\n    }\n]\n\n```\n\n```python\n\ndata2 = [\n    {\n        \"color\": \"blue.5\",\n        \"name\": \"Group 1\",\n        \"data\": [\n            {\"age\": 25, \"BMI\": 20},\n            {\"age\": 30, \"BMI\": 22},\n            {\"age\": 35, \"BMI\": 18},\n            {\"age\": 40, \"BMI\": 25},\n            {\"age\": 45, \"BMI\": 30},\n            {\"age\": 28, \"BMI\": 15},\n            {\"age\": 22, \"BMI\": 12},\n            {\"age\": 50, \"BMI\": 28},\n            {\"age\": 32, \"BMI\": 19},\n            {\"age\": 48, \"BMI\": 31},\n            {\"age\": 26, \"BMI\": 24},\n            {\"age\": 38, \"BMI\": 27},\n            {\"age\": 42, \"BMI\": 29},\n            {\"age\": 29, \"BMI\": 16},\n            {\"age\": 34, \"BMI\": 23},\n            {\"age\": 44, \"BMI\": 33},\n            {\"age\": 23, \"BMI\": 14},\n            {\"age\": 37, \"BMI\": 26},\n            {\"age\": 49, \"BMI\": 34},\n            {\"age\": 27, \"BMI\": 17},\n            {\"age\": 41, \"BMI\": 32},\n            {\"age\": 31, \"BMI\": 21},\n            {\"age\": 46, \"BMI\": 35},\n            {\"age\": 24, \"BMI\": 13},\n            {\"age\": 33, \"BMI\": 22},\n            {\"age\": 39, \"BMI\": 28},\n            {\"age\": 47, \"BMI\": 30},\n            {\"age\": 36, \"BMI\": 25},\n            {\"age\": 43, \"BMI\": 29},\n            {\"age\": 21, \"BMI\": 11}\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"color\": \"red.5\",\n        \"name\": \"Group 2\",\n        \"data\": [\n            {\"age\": 26, \"BMI\": 21},\n            {\"age\": 31, \"BMI\": 24},\n            {\"age\": 37, \"BMI\": 19},\n            {\"age\": 42, \"BMI\": 27},\n            {\"age\": 29, \"BMI\": 32},\n            {\"age\": 35, \"BMI\": 18},\n            {\"age\": 40, \"BMI\": 23},\n            {\"age\": 45, \"BMI\": 30},\n            {\"age\": 27, \"BMI\": 15},\n            {\"age\": 33, \"BMI\": 20},\n            {\"age\": 38, \"BMI\": 25},\n            {\"age\": 43, \"BMI\": 29},\n            {\"age\": 30, \"BMI\": 16},\n            {\"age\": 36, \"BMI\": 22},\n            {\"age\": 41, \"BMI\": 28},\n            {\"age\": 46, \"BMI\": 33},\n            {\"age\": 28, \"BMI\": 17},\n            {\"age\": 34, \"BMI\": 22},\n            {\"age\": 39, \"BMI\": 26},\n            {\"age\": 44, \"BMI\": 31},\n            {\"age\": 32, \"BMI\": 18},\n            {\"age\": 38, \"BMI\": 23},\n            {\"age\": 43, \"BMI\": 28},\n            {\"age\": 48, \"BMI\": 35},\n            {\"age\": 25, \"BMI\": 14},\n            {\"age\": 31, \"BMI\": 20},\n            {\"age\": 36, \"BMI\": 25},\n            {\"age\": 41, \"BMI\": 30},\n            {\"age\": 29, \"BMI\": 16}\n        ]\n    }\n]\n\n```\n\n### Multiple Series\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data2\n\ncomponent = dmc.ScatterChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data2,\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"age\", \"y\": \"BMI\"},\n    xAxisLabel=\"Age\",\n    yAxisLabel=\"BMI\",\n)\n```\n### Legend\nTo display chart legend, set `withLegend` prop. When one of the items in the legend is hovered, the corresponding data\nseries is highlighted in the chart.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data2\n\ncomponent = dmc.ScatterChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data2,\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"age\", \"y\": \"BMI\"},\n    xAxisLabel=\"Age\",\n    yAxisLabel=\"BMI\",\n    withLegend=True,\n)\n```\n### Legend position\nYou can pass props down to recharts Legend component with `legendProps` prop. For example, setting the following will\nrender the legend at the bottom of the chart and set its height to 50px:\n```python\nlegendProps={'verticalAlign': 'bottom', 'height': 50} \n```\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data2\n\ncomponent = dmc.ScatterChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data2,\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"age\", \"y\": \"BMI\"},\n    xAxisLabel=\"Age\",\n    yAxisLabel=\"BMI\",\n    withLegend=True,\n    legendProps={\"verticalAlign\": \"bottom\", \"height\": 20},\n)\n```\n### X and Y axis props\nUse `xAxisProps` and `yAxisProps` to pass props down to recharts `XAxis` and `YAxis` components. For example, these props can\nbe used to change orientation of axis:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data1\n\ncomponent = dmc.ScatterChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data1,\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"age\", \"y\": \"BMI\"},\n    tickLine=\"xy\",\n    yAxisProps={\"tickMargin\": 15, \"orientation\": \"right\"},\n    xAxisProps={\"tickMargin\": 15, \"orientation\": \"top\"},\n)\n```\n### Point labels\nSet `pointLabels` prop to `x` or `y` to display labels on data points for the corresponding axis:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data1\n\ncomponent = dmc.ScatterChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data1,\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"age\", \"y\": \"BMI\"},\n    tickLine=\"xy\",\n    xAxisLabel=\"Age\",\n    yAxisLabel=\"BMI\",\n    pointLabels=\"x\",\n)\n```\n### Stroke dash array\nSet `strokeDasharray` prop to control the stroke dash array of the grid and cursor lines. The value represent the\nlengths of alternating dashes and gaps. For example, strokeDasharray=\"10 5\" will render a dashed line with 10px dashes\nand 5px gaps.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data1\n\ncomponent = dmc.ScatterChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data1,\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"age\", \"y\": \"BMI\"},\n    xAxisLabel=\"Age\",\n    yAxisLabel=\"BMI\",\n    strokeDasharray=\"15, 15\",\n)\n```\n### Grid and text colors\nUse `--chart-grid-color` and `--chart-text-color` to change colors of grid lines and text within the chart. \nWith CSS , you can change colors depending on color scheme.  Learn more in the Theming section under [Colors.](/colors#colors-in-light-and-dark-mode)\n\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nfrom .data import data1\n\ncomponent = dmc.ScatterChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data1,\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"age\", \"y\": \"BMI\"},\n    tickLine=\"xy\",\n    xAxisLabel=\"Age\",\n    yAxisLabel=\"BMI\",\n    className=\"chart-grid-text-colors\",\n)\n```\n\n```css\n\n.chart-grid-text-colors {\n  --chart-grid-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-5);\n  --chart-text-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-8);\n}\n\n[data-mantine-color-scheme='dark'] .chart-grid-text-colors {\n  --chart-grid-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-3);\n  --chart-text-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-2);\n}\n```\n\nIf your application has only one color scheme, you can use `gridColor` and `textColor` props instead of CSS variables:\n\n```python\n\ndmc.ScatterChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data1,\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"age\", \"y\": \"BMI\"},\n    tickLine=\"xy\",\n    xAxisLabel=\"Age\",\n    yAxisLabel=\"BMI\",\n    gridColor=\"gray.5\",\n    textColor = \"gray.9\",\n)\n\n```\n\n### Units\nSet `unit` prop to render a unit label next to the y-axis ticks and tooltip values:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nspending_data = [\n    {\n        \"color\": \"cyan\",\n        \"name\": \"Average monthly spending\",\n        \"data\": [\n            {\"age\": a, \"average_monthly_spending\": b}\n            for a, b in zip(\n                [\n                    25,\n                    30,\n                    35,\n                    40,\n                    45,\n                    28,\n                    22,\n                    50,\n                    32,\n                    48,\n                    26,\n                    38,\n                    42,\n                    29,\n                    34,\n                    44,\n                    23,\n                    37,\n                    49,\n                    27,\n                    41,\n                    31,\n                    46,\n                    24,\n                    33,\n                    39,\n                    47,\n                    36,\n                    43,\n                    21,\n                ],\n                [\n                    1400,\n                    2100,\n                    1800,\n                    2400,\n                    2300,\n                    1600,\n                    1200,\n                    3200,\n                    1900,\n                    2700,\n                    1700,\n                    2200,\n                    2600,\n                    1500,\n                    2000,\n                    2500,\n                    1300,\n                    2100,\n                    2900,\n                    1600,\n                    2500,\n                    1800,\n                    2700,\n                    1400,\n                    2100,\n                    2400,\n                    2800,\n                    2200,\n                    2600,\n                    1100,\n                ],\n            )\n        ],\n    }\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.ScatterChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=spending_data,\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"age\", \"y\": \"average_monthly_spending\"},\n    yAxisProps={\"domain\": [800, 3500]},\n    unit={\"y\": \"$\"},\n    labels={\"x\": \"Age\", \"y\": \"Spending\"},\n)\n```\n### Value formatter\n\nTo format values in the tooltip and axis ticks, use `valueFormatter` prop.

For example:\n```python\n tooltipProps={'content': {'functon': 'myFunction'}}\n```\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data1\n\ncomponent = dmc.ScatterChart(\n    h=350,\n    data=data1,\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"age\", \"y\": \"BMI\"},\n    xAxisLabel=\"Age\",\n    yAxisLabel=\"BMI\",\n    tooltipProps={\"content\":  {\"function\": \"chartTooltip\"}}\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\nvar dmc = window.dash_mantine_components;\n\ndmcfuncs.chartTooltip = ({ label, payload }) => {\n\n  if (!payload || payload.length === 0) return null;\n\n  return React.createElement(\n    dmc.Paper,\n    {\n      px: \"md\",\n      py: \"sm\",\n      withBorder: true,\n      shadow: \"md\",\n      radius: \"md\",\n    },\n    [\n      React.createElement(\n        dmc.Text,\n        {\n          key: \"tooltip-label\",\n          fw: 500,\n          mb: 5,\n        },\n        label\n      ),\n      ...payload.map((item, index) =>\n        React.createElement(\n          dmc.Text,\n          {\n            key: `item-${index}`,\n            c: item.color,\n            fz: \"sm\",\n          },\n          `${item.name}: ${item.value}`\n        )\n      ),\n    ]\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Remove tooltip\nTo remove tooltip, set `withTooltip=False`. It also removes the cursor line and disables interactions with the chart.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data1\n\ncomponent = dmc.ScatterChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data1,\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"age\", \"y\": \"BMI\"},\n    xAxisLabel=\"Age\",\n    yAxisLabel=\"BMI\",\n    withTooltip=False,\n)\n```\n### Tooltip animation\nBy default, tooltip animation is disabled. To enable it, set `tooltipAnimationDuration` prop to a number of\nmilliseconds to animate the tooltip position change.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data1\n\ncomponent = dmc.ScatterChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data1,\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"age\", \"y\": \"BMI\"},\n    xAxisLabel=\"Age\",\n    yAxisLabel=\"BMI\",\n    tooltipAnimationDuration=200,\n)\n```\n### Points animation\nBy default, the Recharts data animation is disabled. To enable and customize the animation, use `scatterProps` to pass properties to the Recharts `Scatter` component.\n\n```python\nfrom random import randint\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Update Chart\", id=\"btn-scatterchart-animation\"),\n        dmc.ScatterChart(\n            h=300,\n            data=[{\"color\": \"blue.5\", \"name\": \"Group 1\", \"data\": [{}]}],\n            scatterProps={\n                \"isAnimationActive\": True,\n                \"animationDuration\": 500,\n                \"animationEasing\": \"ease-in-out\",\n                \"animationBegin\": 500,\n            },\n            dataKey={\"x\": \"x\", \"y\": \"y\"},\n            xAxisLabel=\"X data\",\n            yAxisLabel=\"Y data\",\n            id=\"scatterchart-animation\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"scatterchart-animation\", \"data\"),\n    Input(\"btn-scatterchart-animation\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\ndef update(n):\n    return [\n        {\n            \"color\": \"blue.5\",\n            \"name\": \"Group 1\",\n            \"data\": [\n                {\"x\": randint(1000, 4000), \"y\": randint(1000, 4000)} for _ in range(20)\n            ],\n        }\n    ]\n```\n### Reference lines\nUse `referenceLines` prop to render reference lines. Reference lines are always rendered behind the chart.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data1\n\ncomponent = dmc.ScatterChart(\n    h=300,\n    data=data1,\n    dataKey={\"x\": \"age\", \"y\": \"BMI\"},\n    xAxisLabel=\"Age\",\n    yAxisLabel=\"BMI\",\n    referenceLines=[\n        {\"y\": 14, \"label\": \"Underweight ↓\", \"color\": \"red.7\"},\n        {\"y\": 19, \"label\": \"Normal weight\", \"color\": \"teal.7\"},\n        {\"y\": 30, \"label\": \"Overweight ↑\", \"color\": \"red.7\"},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### clickData\nUse the `clickData` property in a callback to retrieve data from the most recent click event. To get the name of the\nclicked series, use the `clickSeriesName` property.\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data2\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.ScatterChart(\n            id=\"figure-scatterchart\",\n            h=300,\n            data=data2,\n            dataKey={\"x\": \"age\", \"y\": \"BMI\"},\n            xAxisLabel=\"Age\",\n            yAxisLabel=\"BMI\",\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"clickdata-scatterchart1\"),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"clickdata-scatterchart2\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"clickdata-scatterchart1\", \"children\"),\n    Output(\"clickdata-scatterchart2\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"figure-scatterchart\", \"clickData\"),\n    Input(\"figure-scatterchart\", \"clickSeriesName\"),\n)\ndef update(data, name):\n    return f\"clickData:  {data}\", f\"clickSeriesName: {name}\"\n```\n### hoverData\nUse the `hoverData` property in a callback to retrieve data from the most recent hover event. To get the name of the \nhovered series, use the `hoverSeriesName` property.\n\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data2\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.ScatterChart(\n            id=\"figure-scatterchart-hover\",\n            h=300,\n            data=data2,\n            dataKey={\"x\": \"age\", \"y\": \"BMI\"},\n            xAxisLabel=\"Age\",\n            yAxisLabel=\"BMI\",\n            withTooltip=False,\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"hoverdata-scatterchart1\"),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"hoverdata-scatterchart2\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"hoverdata-scatterchart1\", \"children\"),\n    Output(\"hoverdata-scatterchart2\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"figure-scatterchart-hover\", \"hoverData\"),\n    Input(\"figure-scatterchart-hover\", \"hoverSeriesName\"),\n)\ndef update(data, name):\n    return f\"hoverData:  {data}\", f\"hoverSeriesName: {name}\"\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n#### ScatterChart selectors\n\n| Selector          | Static selector                  | Description                                     |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| root              | .mantine-ScatterChart-root      | Root element                                    |\n| scatter           | .mantine-ScatterChart-scatter   | Recharts Scatter component                      |\n| axis              | .mantine-ScatterChart-axis      | X and Y axis of the chart                       |\n| container         | .mantine-ScatterChart-container | Recharts ResponsiveContainer component          |\n| grid              | .mantine-ScatterChart-grid      | Recharts CartesianGrid component                |\n| legend            | .mantine-ScatterChart-legend    | Legend root element                             |\n| legendItem        | .mantine-ScatterChart-legendItem | Legend item representing data series          |\n| legendItemColor   | .mantine-ScatterChart-legendItemColor | Legend item color                        |\n| legendItemName    | .mantine-ScatterChart-legendItemName | Legend item name                          |\n| tooltip           | .mantine-ScatterChart-tooltip   | Tooltip root element                            |\n| tooltipBody       | .mantine-ScatterChart-tooltipBody | Tooltip wrapper around all items              |\n| tooltipItem       | .mantine-ScatterChart-tooltipItem | Tooltip item representing data series        |\n| tooltipItemBody   | .mantine-ScatterChart-tooltipItemBody | Tooltip item wrapper around item color and name |\n| tooltipItemColor  | .mantine-ScatterChart-tooltipItemColor | Tooltip item color                         |\n| tooltipItemName   | .mantine-ScatterChart-tooltipItemName | Tooltip item name                           |\n| tooltipItemData   | .mantine-ScatterChart-tooltipItemData | Tooltip item data                           |\n| tooltipLabel      | .mantine-ScatterChart-tooltipLabel | Label of the tooltip                           |\n| referenceLine     | .mantine-ScatterChart-referenceLine | Reference line                                 |\n| axisLabel         | .mantine-ScatterChart-axisLabel | X and Y axis labels                            |\n\n\n#### ScatterChart CSS variables\n| Selector       | Variable           | Description                              |\n|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| root           | --chart-grid-color | Controls color of the grid and cursor lines |\n|                | --chart-text-color | Controls color of the axis labels         |\n\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### ScatterChart\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

The prop accepts an object with `positive`, `negative` and `neutral` properties:\n\n- `positive` - color for positive trend (first value is less than the last value in data array)\n- `negative` - color for negative trend (first value is greater than the last value in data array)\n- `neutral` - color for neutral trend (first and last values are equal)\n\n`neutral` is optional, if not provided, the color will be the same as `positive`.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\npositive_trend = [10, 20, 40, 20, 40, 10, 50]\nnegative_trend = [50, 40, 20, 40, 20, 40, 10]\nneutral_trend = [10, 20, 40, 20, 40, 10, 50, 5, 10]\n\n\ndef make_sparkline(trend):\n    return dmc.Sparkline(\n        w=200,\n        h=60,\n        data=trend,\n        trendColors={\"positive\": \"teal.6\", \"negative\": \"red.6\", \"neutral\": \"gray.5\"},\n        fillOpacity=0.2,\n    )\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.Text(\"Positive Trend\"),\n        make_sparkline(positive_trend),\n        dmc.Text(\"Negative Trend\", mt=\"md\"),\n        make_sparkline(negative_trend),\n        dmc.Text(\"Neutral Trend\", mt=\"md\"),\n        make_sparkline(neutral_trend),\n    ],\n    gap=\"md\",\n)\n```\n### Change area color depending on color scheme\nYou can use CSS variables in color property. Learn more in the Theming section under [Colors.](/colors#colors-in-light-and-dark-mode)\n\nExample of area color that is dark orange in light mode and lime in dark mode:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Sparkline(w=200, h=60, data=[10, 20, 40, 20, 40, 10, 50], className=\"chart-color\")\n```\n\n```css\n:root {\n   --chart-color: var(--mantine-color-orange-8)\n}\n\n:root[data-mantine-color-scheme=\"dark\"] {\n  --chart-color: var(--mantine-color-lime-4);\n}\n```\n\n\n### Sparkline animation\nBy default, the Recharts data animation is disabled. To enable and customize the animation, use `areaProps` to pass properties to the Recharts `Area` component.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Update Chart\", id=\"btn-spark-animation\", n_clicks=0),\n        dmc.Sparkline(\n            w=200,\n            h=60,\n            data=[],\n            areaProps={\"isAnimationActive\": True},\n            color=\"blue\",\n            id=\"spark-animation\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"spark-animation\", \"data\"), Input(\"btn-spark-animation\", \"n_clicks\"))\ndef update(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return [10, 20, 40, 20, 40, 10, 50]\n    return [50, 10, 30, 10, 40, 50, 10]\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n#### Sparkline selectors\n\n| Selector    | Static selector         | Description                             |\n|:------------|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------|\n| root        | .mantine-Sparkline-root | Root element                            |\n\n\n#### Sparkline CSS variables\n\n| Selector         | Variable             | Description                        |\n|:-----------------|:---------------------|:-----------------------------------|\n| root             | --chart-color        | Controls stroke and fill colors    |\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### Sparkline\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- areaProps (dict; optional):\n    Props passed down to recharts `Area` component.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

    "content": "\n\n## Autocomplete  \nAutocomplete user input with any list of options.  \nCategory: Combobox  \n\n> Need users to select multiple items? See `MultiSelect` or `TagsInput`.\n\n\nUse `Autocomplete` component in the following cases:\n\n- You want to allow user to enter any value\n- You want to display suggestions to the user based on the input value\n- You want to preserve user input on blur if option was not selected from the dropdown\n- `value` and `label` of the option are the same.\n\n\n### Not a searchable select\n\n`Autocomplete` is not a searchable select, it is a text input with suggestions. Values are not enforced to be one of\nthe suggestions, user can type anything. If you need a searchable select, use `Select` component instead.\n To learn more about the differences between Autocomplete and Select, check [help center article](https://help.mantine.dev/q/select-autocomplete-difference).\n\n\n### Made with Combobox\n\n`Autocomplete` is built on top of [Combobox](https://mantine.dev/core/combobox/) and covers common use cases. If you need more advanced behavior or want to extend\nits functionality, you can create your own custom `Autocomplete` component.  See this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dmc_custom_components) for custom DMC component examples.\n\n### Simple Example\n\n`Autocomplete` provides user a list of suggestions based on the input, however user is not limited to suggestions and can type anything.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, html, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Autocomplete(\n            label=\"Your favorite library\",\n            placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n            id=\"framework-autocomplete\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            mb=10,\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"autocomplete-value\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"autocomplete-value\", \"children\"), Input(\"framework-autocomplete\", \"value\"))\ndef select_value(value):\n    return f\" You selected {value}\"\n```\n### Select first option on change\n\nSet the `selectFirstOptionOnChange` prop to automatically select the first option in the dropdown when the input value\nchanges. This feature allows users to type a value and immediately press Enter to select the first matching option,\nwithout needing to press the arrow down key first.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    label=\"Select your favorite library\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n    selectFirstOptionOnChange=True,\n)\n```\n### autoSelectOnBlur\n\nSet `autoSelectOnBlur=True` to automatically select the highlighted option when the input loses focus. To see this\nfeature in action: select an option with up/down arrows, then click outside the input:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    label=\"Your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    autoSelectOnBlur=True,\n    clearable=True,\n)\n```\n### Data Format\n\n`Autoselect` `data` prop accepts data in one of the following formats:\n\n```python\ndata = [\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"]\n\n# or\n\ndata = [\n    {\"group\": \"US\", \"items\": [\"New York\", \"Seattle\"]},\n    {\"group\": \"Canada\", \"items\": [\"Montreal\", \"Vancouver\"]}\n]\n```\n\n### Options filtering\n\nBy default, `Autocomplete` filters options by checking if the option label contains input value. You can change this behavior \nwith `filter`. The filter function receives an object with the following properties as a single argument:\n - `options` – array of options or options groups, all options are in `{ value: string; label: string; disabled?: boolean }` format\n - `search` – current search query\n - `limit` – value of limit prop passed to `Autocomplete`\n\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\nExample of a custom filter function that matches options by words instead of letters sequence:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    label=\"Your country\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n    data=[\n        \"Great Britain\",\n        \"Canada\",\n        \"United States\",\n    ],\n    filter={\"function\": \"filterCountries\"},\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.filterCountries = function ({ options, search }) {\n  const queryWords = search.toLowerCase().trim().split(\" \");\n  return options.filter((option) => {\n    const words = option.label.toLowerCase().trim().split(\" \");\n    return queryWords.every((word) =>\n      words.some((labelWord) => labelWord.includes(word))\n    );\n  });\n};\n```\n\n\n### Sort options\n\nBy default, options are sorted by their position in the data array. You can change this behavior with `filter` function:\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    label=\"Your favorite Python library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n    data=[\n        \"4 – NumPy\",\n        \"1 – Pandas\",\n        \"3 – Scikit-learn\",\n        \"2 – Plotly\",\n    ],\n    filter={\"function\": \"filterPythonLibs\"},\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.filterPythonLibs = function ({ options, search }) {\n  const query = search.toLowerCase().trim();\n  const result = options.filter((option) =>\n    option.label.toLowerCase().trim().includes(query)\n  );\n  result.sort((a, b) => a.label.localeCompare(b.label));\n  return result;\n};\n```\n\n\n### Large Data Sets\n\nThe best strategy for large data sets is to limit the number of options that are rendered at the same time. You can\ndo it with limit prop. \n\nNote that if you use a custom `filter` function, you need to implement your own logic to limit the number of options in filter\n\nExample of `Autocomplete` with 100 000 options, 10 options are rendered at the same time:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    label=\"100,000 options\",\n    data=[f\"Option {i}\" for i in range(100000)],\n    placeholder=\"use limit to optimize performance\",\n    limit=10,\n)\n```\n### renderOption\n\n`renderOption` function allows you to customize option rendering.\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n\n```python\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    label=\"Select with renderOption\",\n    placeholder=\"Select text align\",\n    data=[\n      { \"value\": 'left', \"label\": 'left' },\n      { \"value\": 'center', \"label\": 'center' },\n      { \"value\": 'right', \"label\": 'right' },\n      { \"value\": 'justify', \"label\": 'justify' },\n    ],\n    renderOption={\"function\": \"renderOptionSelect\"},\n    clearable=True\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\nvar dmc = window.dash_mantine_components;\nvar iconify = window.dash_iconify;\n\n\ndmcfuncs.renderOptionSelect = function ({ option, checked }) {\n\n  const icons = {\n   left: React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, { icon: \"mdi:format-align-left\", width: 24 }),\n   center: React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, { icon: \"mdi:format-align-center\", width: 24 }),\n   right: React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, { icon: \"mdi:format-align-right\", width: 24 }),\n   justify: React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, { icon: \"mdi:format-align-justify\", width: 24 }),\n  };\n\n  const checkedIcon = React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, {\n    icon: \"mdi:check\",\n    width: 24,\n  });\n\n  return React.createElement(\n    dmc.Group,\n    { flex: \"1\", gap: \"xs\" },\n    icons[option.value],\n    option.label,\n    checked ? checkedIcon : null\n  );\n};\n```\n\n\n### Nothing found message\n\n`Autocomplete` component does not support nothing found message. It is designed to accept any string as a value, so it\ndoes not make sense to show nothing found message. If you want to limit user input to suggestions, you can use\nsearchable `Select` component instead. To learn more about the differences between `Autocomplete` and `Select`, check this [help center article](https://help.mantine.dev/q/select-autocomplete-difference).\n\n\n### Scrollable dropdown\n\nBy default, the options list is wrapped with `ScrollArea.Autosize`. You can control dropdown max-height with \n`maxDropdownHeight` prop if you do not change the default settings.\n\nIf you want to use native scrollbars, set `withScrollArea=False`. Note that in this case, you will need to change \ndropdown styles with `Styles API`.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Paper(\n    [\n        dmc.Autocomplete(\n            label=\"Scrollable dropdown\",\n            data=[f\"Option {i}\" for i in range(100)],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n            maxDropdownHeight=300,\n        ),\n        dmc.Autocomplete(\n            label=\"With native scroll\",\n            data=[f\"Option {i}\" for i in range(100)],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n            withScrollArea=False,\n            styles={\"dropdown\": {\"maxHeight\": 200, \"overflowY\": \"auto\"}},\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Group options\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    data=[\n        {\n            \"group\": \"Data Analysis\",\n            \"items\": [\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\"],\n        },\n        {\n            \"group\": \"Deep Learning\",\n            \"items\": [\"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n        },\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Disabled options\n\nWhen option is disabled, it cannot be selected and is ignored in keyboard navigation.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    label=\"Your favorite library:\",\n    data=[\n        {\"value\":\"Pandas\"},\n        {\"value\": \"NumPy\"},\n        {\"value\":\"TensorFlow\",  \"disabled\": True},\n        {\"value\":\"PyTorch\", \"disabled\": True}\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Combobox props\nYou can override `Combobox` props with `comboboxProps`. It is useful when you need to change some of the props that are\nnot exposed by `Autocomplete`, for example `withinPortal`:\n\n```python\ndmc.Autocomplete(comboboxProps={\"withinPortal\": False})\n```\n\n\n### Change dropdown z-index\n\n```python\ndmc.Autocomplete(comboboxProps={\"zIndex\": 1000})\n```\n\n### Inside Popover\n\nTo use `Autocomplete` inside popover, you need to set `withinPortal=False`:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Popover(\n    position=\"bottom\",\n    withArrow=True,\n    shadow=\"md\",\n    children=[\n        dmc.PopoverTarget(dmc.Button(\"Toggle Popover\")),\n        dmc.PopoverDropdown(\n            dmc.Autocomplete(\n                label=\"Your favorite library\",\n                placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n                data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n                comboboxProps={\"withinPortal\": False},\n            )\n        ),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Clearable\n\nSet `clearable` prop to display the clear button in the right section. The button is not displayed when:\n\n- The component does not have a value\n- The component is disabled\n- The component is read only\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    label=\"Your favorite library:\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    value=\"Pandas\",\n    clearable=True,\n)\n```\n### Dropdown open in a callback\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, html, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Toggle dropdown\", id=\"btn-autocomplete-opened\", n_clicks=0),\n        dmc.Autocomplete(\n            label=\"Select your favorite library\",\n            placeholder=\"Select value\",\n            id=\"autocomplete-opened\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            comboboxProps={\"position\": \"bottom\", \"middlewares\": {\"flip\": False, \"shift\": False}},\n            mb=10,\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"autocomplete-opened\", \"dropdownOpened\"), Input(\"btn-autocomplete-opened\", \"n_clicks\")\n)\ndef select_value(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    return True\n```\n### Dropdown position\n\nBy default, the dropdown is displayed below the input if there is enough space; otherwise it is displayed above the\ninput. You can change this behavior by setting `position` and `middlewares` props, which are passed down to the\nunderlying `Popover` component.\n\nExample of dropdown that is always displayed above the input:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    label=\"Your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\"position\": \"top\", \"middlewares\": {\"flip\": False, \"shift\": False}},\n)\n```\n### Dropdown width\n\nTo change dropdown width, set `width` prop in `comboboxProps`. By default, dropdown width is equal to the input width.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    label=\"Your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\"position\": \"bottom-start\", \"width\": 200},\n)\n```\n### Dropdown offset\n\nTo change dropdown offset, set `offset` prop in `comboboxProps`:  \n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    label=\"Your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\n        \"position\": \"bottom\",\n        \"middlewares\": {\"flip\": False, \"shift\": False},\n        \"offset\": 0,\n    },\n)\n```\n### Dropdown animation\nBy default, dropdown animations are disabled. To enable them, you can set `transitionProps`, which will be passed\ndown to the underlying `Transition` component.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    label=\"Your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\"transitionProps\": {\"transition\": \"pop\", \"duration\": 200}},\n)\n```\n### Dropdown padding\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Paper(\n    [\n        dmc.Autocomplete(\n            label=\"Zero padding\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n            comboboxProps={\"dropdownPadding\": 0},\n        ),\n        dmc.Autocomplete(\n            label=\"10px padding\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n            comboboxProps={\"dropdownPadding\": 10},\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Dropdown shadow\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    label=\"Your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\"shadow\": \"md\"},\n)\n```\n### Left and right sections\n\n`Autocomplete` supports `leftSection` and `rightSection` props. These sections are rendered with absolute position\ninside the input wrapper. You can use them to display icons, input controls or any other elements.\n\nYou can use the following props to control sections styles and content:\n\n- `rightSection`/`leftSection` – component to render on the corresponding side of input\n- `rightSectionWidth`/`leftSectionWidth` – controls width of the right section and padding on the corresponding side of the input. By default, it is controlled by component size prop.\n- `rightSectionPointerEvents`/`leftSectionPointerEvents` – controls pointer-events property of the section. If you want to render a non-interactive element, set it to none to pass clicks through to the input.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Paper(\n    [\n        dmc.Autocomplete(\n            label=\"Your favorite library\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anythings\",\n            leftSectionPointerEvents=\"none\",\n            leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"bi-book\"),\n        ),\n        dmc.Autocomplete(\n            label=\"Your favorite library\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n            rightSectionPointerEvents=\"none\",\n            rightSection=DashIconify(icon=\"bi-book\"),\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Input Props\n`Autocomplete` component supports `Input` and Input Wrapper components features and all input element props.\n`Autocomplete` documentation does not include all features supported by the component – see Input documentation to learn about all available features.\n\n\n### Read only\nSet `readOnly` to make the input read only. When readOnly is set, `Autocomplete` will not show suggestions and will not\ncall onChange function.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    label=\"Your favorite library:\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    readOnly=True,\n)\n```\n### Invalid State And Error\n\n\nNote: Dash adds some css by default which can lead you to see a red box when setting the `required` or `error` \nprop to True. Use the below css snippet to counteract it.\n\n```css\ninput:invalid {\n    outline: none !important;\n}\n```\n\nYou can let the user know if the selected value is invalid. In the example below, you will get an error message if you\nselect less than 2 currency pairs.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, callback\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    data=[\"USDINR\", \"EURUSD\", \"USDTWD\", \"USDJPY\"],\n    id=\"autocomplete-error\",\n    value=\"USDJPY\",\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"autocomplete-error\", \"error\"), Input(\"autocomplete-error\", \"value\"))\ndef select_value(value):\n    return \"JPY is not allowed!\" if value == \"USDJPY\" else \"\"\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n### Autocomplete Selectors\n\n| Selector     | Static selector                        | Description                                              |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| `wrapper`    | `.mantine-Autocomplete-wrapper`        | Root element of the Input                                |\n| `input`      | `.mantine-Autocomplete-input`          | Input element                                            |\n| `section`    | `.mantine-Autocomplete-section`        | Left and right sections                                  |\n| `root`       | `.mantine-Autocomplete-root`           | Root element                                             |\n| `label`      | `.mantine-Autocomplete-label`          | Label element                                            |\n| `required`   | `.mantine-Autocomplete-required`       | Required asterisk element, rendered inside label         |\n| `description`| `.mantine-Autocomplete-description`    | Description element                                      |\n| `error`      | `.mantine-Autocomplete-error`          | Error element                                            |\n| `dropdown`   | `.mantine-Autocomplete-dropdown`       | Dropdown root element                                    |\n| `options`    | `.mantine-Autocomplete-options`        | Options wrapper                                          |\n| `option`     | `.mantine-Autocomplete-option`         | Option                                                   |\n| `group`      | `.mantine-Autocomplete-group`          | Options group wrapper                                    |\n| `groupLabel` | `.mantine-Autocomplete-groupLabel`     | Options group label                                      |\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### Autocomplete\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

    "content": "\n\n## MultiSelect  \nMultiSelect enables users to select multiple options in a dropdown.  \nCategory: Combobox  \n\n### Made with Combobox\n\n`MultiSelect` is built on top of [Combobox](https://mantine.dev/core/combobox/) and covers common use cases. If you need more advanced behavior or want to extend\nits functionality, you can create your own custom `MultiSelect` component. See this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dmc_custom_components) for custom DMC component examples.\n\n\n### Simple Example\n\nMultiSelect component allows user to pick any number of option from the given data.\nIf you would like users to be able to enter custom values, see `TagsInput`.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, html, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.MultiSelect(\n            label=\"Select your favorite libraries\",\n            placeholder=\"Select all you like!\",\n            id=\"framework-multi-select\",\n            value=[\"pd\", \"torch\"],\n            data=[\n                {\"value\": \"pd\", \"label\": \"Pandas\"},\n                {\"value\": \"np\", \"label\": \"NumPy\"},\n                {\"value\": \"tf\", \"label\": \"TensorFlow\"},\n                {\"value\": \"torch\", \"label\": \"PyTorch\"},\n            ],\n            w=400,\n            mb=10,\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"multi-selected-value\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"multi-selected-value\", \"children\"), Input(\"framework-multi-select\", \"value\")\n)\ndef select_value(value):\n    return \", \".join(value)\n```\n### Data Format\n\nThe data can be provided as either:\n* an array of strings - use when label and value are same.\n* an array of dicts with `label` and `value` properties.\n* an array of dict with `group` and `items` as keys where items are one of the previous two types.\n\n```python\ndata = [\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"]\n\n# or\n\ndata = [\n    {\"value\": \"Pandas\", \"label\": \"Pandas\"},\n    {\"value\": \"NumPy\", \"label\": \"NumPy\"},\n    {\"value\": \"TensorFlow\", \"label\": \"TensorFlow\"},\n    {\"value\": \"PyTorch\", \"label\": \"PyTorch\"},\n]\n\n# or\n\ndata = [\n    {\"group\": \"Data Analysis\", \"items\": [\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\"]},\n    {\"group\": \"Deep Learning\", \"items\": [\"TensorFlow\", \"Pytorch\"]}\n]\n\n# or\n\ndata = [\n    {\n        \"group\": \"Data Analysis\",\n        \"items\": [\n            {\"value\": \"Pandas\", \"label\": \"Pandas\"},\n            {\"value\": \"NumPy\", \"label\": \"NumPy\"},\n        ],\n    },\n    {\n        \"group\": \"Deep Learning\",\n        \"items\": [\n            {\"value\": \"TensorFlow\", \"label\": \"TensorFlow\"},\n            {\"value\": \"PyTorch\", \"label\": \"PyTorch\"},\n        ],\n    },\n]\n```\n\n### Clearable\n\nSet `clearable` prop to display the clear button in the right section. The button is not displayed when:\n\n- The component does not have a value\n- The component is disabled\n- The component is read only\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    label=\"Select your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Select all you like!\",\n    value=[\"Pandas\", \"TensorFlow\"],\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    clearable=True,\n    w=400,\n    mb=180,\n)\n```\n### Searchable\n\nSet `searchable` prop to allow filtering options by user input.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    label=\"Pick your favorite libraries\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    searchable=True,\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### Nothing Found\n\nSet the `nothingFoundMessage` prop to display a given message when no options match the search query or there is \nno data available. If the `nothingFoundMessage` prop is not set, the `MultiSelect` dropdown will be hidden.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    label=\"Pick your favorite libraries\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    searchable=True,\n    nothingFoundMessage=\"Nothing found...\",\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### Clear search on change\n\nSet the `clearSearchOnChange=False` to enable selecting multiple items using the same search query.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    data=[\"aa\", \"ab\", \"ac\", \"ba\", \"bb\", \"bc\"],\n    value=[\"aa\"],\n    searchable=True,\n    clearSearchOnChange=False\n)\n```\n### Checked option icon\n\nSet `checkIconPosition` prop to `left` or `right` to control position of check icon in active option.\nTo remove the check icon, set `withCheckIcon=False`.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    label=\"Control check icon\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    value=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\"],\n    checkIconPosition=\"right\",\n    dropdownOpened=True,\n    w=400,\n    pb=150,\n    id=\"multi-select-check-icon\",\n    comboboxProps={\"withinPortal\": False}\n\n)\n```\n### Max Selected Values\n\nYou can limit the number of selected values with `maxValues` prop. This will not allow adding more values\nonce the limit is reached.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    label=\"Select your favorite\",\n    description=\"You can select a maximum of 3 frameworks.\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    maxValues=3,\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### Hide selected options\n\nTo remove selected options from the list of available options, set `hidePickedOptions` prop:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    label=\"Select your favorite libraries\",\n    placeholder=\"Select all you like!\",\n    hidePickedOptions=True,\n    value=[\"Pandas\", \"TensorFlow\"],\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    w=400,\n    mb=140,\n    dropdownOpened=True,\n    comboboxProps={\"withinPortal\":False}\n)\n```\n### Large Data Sets\n\nThe best strategy for large data sets is to limit the number of options that are rendered at the same time. You can\ndo it with limit prop. \n\nExample of `MultiSelect` with 100 000 options, 10 options are rendered at the same time:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    label=\"100,000 options\",\n    data=[f\"Option {i}\" for i in range(100000)],\n    placeholder=\"use limit to optimize performance\",\n    limit=10,\n    searchable=True,\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### renderOption\n\n`renderOption` function allows you to customize option rendering.\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nusers_data = {\n    \"Emily Johnson\": {\n        \"image\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/avatars/avatar-7.png\",\n        \"email\": \"emily92@gmail.com\",\n    },\n    \"Ava Rodriguez\": {\n        \"image\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/avatars/avatar-8.png\",\n        \"email\": \"ava_rose@gmail.com\",\n    },\n    \"Olivia Chen\": {\n        \"image\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/avatars/avatar-4.png\",\n        \"email\": \"livvy_globe@gmail.com\",\n    },\n    \"Ethan Barnes\": {\n        \"image\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/avatars/avatar-1.png\",\n        \"email\": \"ethan_explorer@gmail.com\",\n    },\n    \"Mason Taylor\": {\n        \"image\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/avatars/avatar-2.png\",\n        \"email\": \"mason_musician@gmail.com\",\n    },\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    data=list(users_data.keys()),\n    label=\"Employees of the month\",\n    placeholder=\"Search for employee\",\n    maxDropdownHeight=300,\n    searchable=True,\n    hidePickedOptions=True,\n    renderOption={\n        \"function\": \"renderUserOption\",\n        \"options\": {\"users\": users_data},\n    },\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\nvar dmc = window.dash_mantine_components;\n\ndmcfuncs.renderUserOption = function ({ option }, { users }) {\n  const user = users[option.value];\n\n  return React.createElement(\n    dmc.Group,\n    { gap: \"sm\" },\n    React.createElement(dmc.Avatar, {\n      key: \"avatar\",\n      src: user.image,\n      size: 36,\n      radius: \"xl\",\n    }),\n    React.createElement(\n      \"div\",\n      { key: \"text-block\" },\n      React.createElement(dmc.Text, { size: \"sm\", key: \"name\" }, option.value),\n      React.createElement(dmc.Text, {\n        size: \"xs\",\n        opacity: 0.5,\n        key: \"email\",\n        children: user.email,\n      })\n    )\n  );\n};\n```\n\n\n### Options filtering\n\nBy default, `MultiSelect` filters options by checking if the option label contains input value. You can change this behavior \nwith `filter`. The filter function receives an object with the following properties as a single argument:\n - `options` – array of options or options groups, all options are in `{ value: string; label: string; disabled?: boolean }` format\n - `search` – current search query\n - `limit` – value of limit prop passed to `Select`\n\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\nExample of a custom filter function that matches options by words instead of letters sequence:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    label=\"Your country\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n    searchable=True,\n    data=[\n        \"Great Britain\",\n        \"Canada\",\n        \"United States\",\n    ],\n    filter={\"function\": \"filterCountries\"},\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.filterCountries = function ({ options, search }) {\n  const queryWords = search.toLowerCase().trim().split(\" \");\n  return options.filter((option) => {\n    const words = option.label.toLowerCase().trim().split(\" \");\n    return queryWords.every((word) =>\n      words.some((labelWord) => labelWord.includes(word))\n    );\n  });\n};\n```\n\n\n### Sort options\n\nBy default, options are sorted by their position in the data array. You can change this behavior with `filter` function:\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    label=\"Your favorite Python library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n    searchable=True,\n    nothingFoundMessage=\"Nothing found...\",\n    data=[\n        \"4 – NumPy\",\n        \"1 – Pandas\",\n        \"3 – Scikit-learn\",\n        \"2 – Plotly\",\n    ],\n    filter={\"function\": \"filterPythonLibs\"},\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.filterPythonLibs = function ({ options, search }) {\n  const query = search.toLowerCase().trim();\n  const result = options.filter((option) =>\n    option.label.toLowerCase().trim().includes(query)\n  );\n  result.sort((a, b) => a.label.localeCompare(b.label));\n  return result;\n};\n```\n\n\n\n\n### Scrollable dropdown\n\nBy default, the options list is wrapped with `ScrollArea.Autosize`. You can control dropdown max-height with \n`maxDropdownHeight` prop if you do not change the default settings.\n\nIf you want to use native scrollbars, set `withScrollArea=False`. Note that in this case, you will need to change \ndropdown styles with `Styles API`.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Paper(\n    [\n        dmc.MultiSelect(\n            label=\"Scrollable dropdown\",\n            data=[f\"Option {i}\" for i in range(100)],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n            maxDropdownHeight=300,\n            w=400,\n        ),\n        dmc.MultiSelect(\n            label=\"With native scroll\",\n            data=[f\"Option {i}\" for i in range(100)],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n            withScrollArea=False,\n            styles={\"dropdown\": {\"maxHeight\": 200, \"overflowY\": \"auto\"}},\n            w=400,\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Grouping\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    data=[\n        {\n            \"group\": \"Data Analysis\",\n            \"items\": [\n                {\"value\": \"Pandas\", \"label\": \"Pandas\"},\n                {\"value\": \"NumPy\", \"label\": \"NumPy\"},\n            ],\n        },\n        {\n            \"group\": \"Deep Learning\",\n            \"items\": [\n                {\"value\": \"TensorFlow\", \"label\": \"TensorFlow\"},\n                {\"value\": \"PyTorch\", \"label\": \"PyTorch\"},\n            ],\n        },\n    ],\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### Combobox props\nYou can override `Combobox` props with `comboboxProps`. It is useful when you need to change some of the props that are\nnot exposed by `MultiSelect`, for example `withinPortal`:\n\n```python\ndmc.MultiSelect(comboboxProps={\"withinPortal\": False})\n```\n\n\n### Change dropdown z-index\n\n\n```python\ndmc.MultiSelect(comboboxProps={\"zIndex\": 1000})\n```\n\n\n### Inside Popover\n\nTo use MultiSelect inside popover, you need to set `withinPortal=False`:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Popover(\n    width=300,\n    position=\"bottom\",\n    withArrow=True,\n    shadow=\"md\",\n    children=[\n        dmc.PopoverTarget(dmc.Button(\"Toggle Popover\")),\n        dmc.PopoverDropdown(\n            dmc.MultiSelect(\n                label=\"Your favorite libraries\",\n                placeholder=\"Pick values\",\n                data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n                comboboxProps={\"withinPortal\": False},\n            )\n        ),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Dropdown open in a callback\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, html, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Toggle dropdown\", id=\"btn-multi-select-opened\", n_clicks=0),\n        dmc.MultiSelect(\n            label=\"Select your favorite libraries\",\n            placeholder=\"Select all you like!\",\n            id=\"multi-select-opened\",\n            value=[\"pd\", \"torch\"],\n            data=[\n                {\"value\": \"pd\", \"label\": \"Pandas\"},\n                {\"value\": \"np\", \"label\": \"NumPy\"},\n                {\"value\": \"tf\", \"label\": \"TensorFlow\"},\n                {\"value\": \"torch\", \"label\": \"PyTorch\"},\n            ],\n            comboboxProps={\"position\": \"bottom\", \"middlewares\": {\"flip\": False, \"shift\": False}},\n            w=400,\n            mb=10,\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"multi-select-opened\", \"dropdownOpened\"),\n    Input(\"btn-multi-select-opened\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\ndef select_value(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    return True\n```\n### Dropdown position\n\nBy default, the dropdown is displayed below the input if there is enough space; otherwise it is displayed above the\ninput. You can change this behavior by setting `position` and `middlewares` props, which are passed down to the\nunderlying `Popover` component.\n\nExample of dropdown that is always displayed above the input:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    label=\"Your favorite libraries\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick values\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\"position\": \"top\", \"middlewares\": {\"flip\": False, \"shift\": False}},\n)\n```\n### Dropdown width\n\nTo change dropdown width, set `width` prop in `comboboxProps`. By default, dropdown width is equal to the input width.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    label=\"Your favorite libraries\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick values\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\"position\": \"bottom-start\", \"width\": 200},\n)\n```\n### Dropdown offset\n\nTo change dropdown offset, set `offset` prop in `comboboxProps`:  \n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    label=\"Your favorite libraries\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick values\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\n        \"position\": \"bottom\",\n        \"middlewares\": {\"flip\": False, \"shift\": False},\n        \"offset\": 0,\n    },\n)\n```\n### Dropdown animation\nBy default, dropdown animations are disabled. To enable them, you can set `transitionProps`, which will be passed\ndown to the underlying `Transition` component.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    label=\"Your favorite libraries\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick values\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\"transitionProps\": {\"transition\": \"pop\", \"duration\": 200}},\n)\n```\n### Dropdown padding\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Paper(\n    [\n        dmc.MultiSelect(\n            label=\"Zero padding\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n            comboboxProps={\"dropdownPadding\": 0},\n            w=400,\n        ),\n        dmc.MultiSelect(\n            label=\"10px padding\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n            comboboxProps={\"dropdownPadding\": 10},\n            w=400,\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Dropdown shadow\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    label=\"Your favorite libraries\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick values\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\"shadow\": \"md\"},\n)\n```\n### Left and right sections\n\n`MultiSelect` supports `leftSection` and `rightSection` props. These sections are rendered with absolute position\ninside the input wrapper. You can use them to display icons, input controls or any other elements.\n\nYou can use the following props to control sections styles and content:\n\n- `rightSection`/`leftSection` – component to render on the corresponding side of input\n- `rightSectionWidth`/`leftSectionWidth` – controls width of the right section and padding on the corresponding side of the input. By default, it is controlled by component size prop.\n- `rightSectionPointerEvents`/`leftSectionPointerEvents` – controls pointer-events property of the section. If you want to render a non-interactive element, set it to none to pass clicks through to the input.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Paper(\n    [\n        dmc.MultiSelect(\n            label=\"Your favorite libraries\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick values\",\n            leftSectionPointerEvents=\"none\",\n            leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"bi-book\"),\n            w=400,\n        ),\n        dmc.MultiSelect(\n            label=\"Your favorite libraries\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick values\",\n            rightSectionPointerEvents=\"none\",\n            rightSection=DashIconify(icon=\"bi-book\"),\n            w=400,\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Invalid State And Error\n\nYou can let the user know if the selected value is invalid. In the example below, you will get an error message if you\nselect less than 2 currency pairs.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, callback\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    data=[\"USDINR\", \"EURUSD\", \"USDTWD\", \"USDJPY\"],\n    id=\"multi-select-error\",\n    value=[\"USDJPY\"],\n    w=400,\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"multi-select-error\", \"error\"), Input(\"multi-select-error\", \"value\"))\ndef select_value(value):\n    return \"Select at least 2.\" if len(value) < 2 else \"\"\n```\n### Input Props\n`MultiSelect` component supports `Input` and Input Wrapper components features and all input element props.\n`MultiSelect` documentation does not include all features supported by the component – see Input documentation to learn about all available features.\n\n \n### Removing placeholder after values selected\n\n`MultiSelect` component uses placeholder to indicate that there are values available for selection. It is different\nfrom `Select` component where placeholder is removed when value is selected – user can select only one value.\n\nYou can use CSS to remove the placeholder in the `MultiSelect` component when values are selected:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Paper(\n    [\n        dmc.MultiSelect(\n            label=\"Default Placeholder\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick values\",\n            value=[\"Pandas\"],\n            w=400,\n        ),\n        dmc.MultiSelect(\n            label=\"Placeholder removed when values are selected\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick values\",\n            value=[\"Pandas\"],\n            className=\"dmc-docs-demo\",\n            w=400,\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n```css\n.dmc-docs-demo .mantine-MultiSelect-inputField {\n  &:not(:only-child)::placeholder {\n    color: transparent;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n### Dash 4 dcc.Dropdown\n\nThe Dash 4 [dcc.Dropdown](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components/dropdown) supports some features that are not \navailable in DMC.  For example, virtualization, which renders only the visible options instead of the entire list. This improves performance and responsiveness when working \nwith large data sets. It also includes a search input and Select all / Deselect all buttons inside the dropdown menu.\nWhen `multi=True`, it displays a count of selected items, preventing the input from resizing as selections grow.\n\nThe `dmc.InputWrapper` can be used to add elements like `label`, `description`, and `error` to the `dcc.Dropdown`,\nmaking it consistent with the other DMC inputs. The `htmlFor` prop links the label to the component for focus and accessibility.\n\nTo style the `dcc.Dropdown` with a Mantine theme see the   [Dash 4 components](/dash4-components) section.\n\n```python\nfrom dash import dcc\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.InputWrapper(\n    dcc.Dropdown([f\"option {i}\" for i in range(100)],  value=[\"option 1\", \"option 2\", \"option 3\"], multi=True, id=\"dcc4-dropdown\"),\n    label=\"dcc.Dropdown with a dmc.InputWrapper\",\n    htmlFor=\"dcc4-dropdown\",\n    className=\"dmc\"  # styles with Mantine theme\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n| Name        | Static selector                  | Description                                      |\n|:------------|:---------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|\n| wrapper     | .mantine-MultiSelect-wrapper     | Root element of the Input                        |\n| input       | .mantine-MultiSelect-input       | Input element                                    |\n| section     | .mantine-MultiSelect-section     | Left and right sections                          |\n| root        | .mantine-MultiSelect-root        | Root element                                     |\n| label       | .mantine-MultiSelect-label       | Label element                                    |\n| required    | .mantine-MultiSelect-required    | Required asterisk element, rendered inside label |\n| description | .mantine-MultiSelect-description | Description element                              |\n| error       | .mantine-MultiSelect-error       | Error element                                    |\n| dropdown    | .mantine-MultiSelect-dropdown    | Dropdown root element                            |\n| options     | .mantine-MultiSelect-options     | Options wrapper                                  |\n| option      | .mantine-MultiSelect-option      | Option                                           |\n| empty       | .mantine-MultiSelect-empty       | Nothing found message                            |\n| group       | .mantine-MultiSelect-group       | Options group wrapper                            |\n| groupLabel  | .mantine-MultiSelect-groupLabel  | Options group label                              |\n| pill        | .mantine-MultiSelect-pill        | Value pill                                       |\n| inputField  | .mantine-MultiSelect-inputField  | Input field                                      |\n| pillsList   | .mantine-MultiSelect-pillsList   | List of pills, also contains input field         |\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### MultiSelect\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

    "content": "\n\n## Select  \nSelect enables users to select an option in a dropdown.  \nCategory: Combobox  \n\n> Need users to select multiple items? See `MultiSelect`.  Need users to type their own options? See `TagsInput` or `Autocomplete`\n\n### Made with Combobox\n\n`Select` is built on top of [Combobox](https://mantine.dev/core/combobox/) and covers common use cases. If you need more advanced behavior or want to extend\nits functionality, you can create your own custom `Select` component. See this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dmc_custom_components) for custom DMC component examples.\n\n\n### Simple Example\n\n`Select` component allows user to pick one option from the given data. Unlike `Autocomplete`, `Select` does not allow entering custom values.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, html, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Select(\n            label=\"Select your favorite library\",\n            placeholder=\"Select one\",\n            id=\"framework-select\",\n            value=\"pd\",\n            data=[\n                {\"value\": \"pd\", \"label\": \"Pandas\"},\n                {\"value\": \"np\", \"label\": \"NumPy\"},\n                {\"value\": \"tf\", \"label\": \"TensorFlow\"},\n                {\"value\": \"torch\", \"label\": \"PyTorch\"},\n            ],\n            w=200,\n            mb=10,\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"selected-value\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"selected-value\", \"children\"), Input(\"framework-select\", \"value\"))\ndef select_value(value):\n    return f\" You selected {value}\"\n```\n### Data Format\n\nThe data can be provided as either:\n* an array of strings - use when label and value are same.\n* an array of dicts with `label` and `value` properties.\n* an array of dict with `group` and `items` as keys where items are one of the previous two types.\n\n```python\ndata = [\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"]\n\n# or\n\ndata = [\n    {\"value\": \"Pandas\", \"label\": \"Pandas\"},\n    {\"value\": \"NumPy\", \"label\": \"NumPy\"},\n    {\"value\": \"TensorFlow\", \"label\": \"TensorFlow\"},\n    {\"value\": \"PyTorch\", \"label\": \"PyTorch\"},\n]\n\n# or\n\ndata = [\n    {\"group\": \"Data Analysis\", \"items\": [\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\"]},\n    {\"group\": \"Deep Learning\", \"items\": [\"TensorFlow\", \"Pytorch\"]}\n]\n\n# or\n\ndata = [\n    {\n        \"group\": \"Data Analysis\",\n        \"items\": [\n            {\"value\": \"Pandas\", \"label\": \"Pandas\"},\n            {\"value\": \"NumPy\", \"label\": \"NumPy\"},\n        ],\n    },\n    {\n        \"group\": \"Deep Learning\",\n        \"items\": [\n            {\"value\": \"TensorFlow\", \"label\": \"TensorFlow\"},\n            {\"value\": \"PyTorch\", \"label\": \"PyTorch\"},\n        ],\n    },\n]\n```\n### autoSelectOnBlur\n\nSet `autoSelectOnBlur=True` to automatically select the highlighted option when the input loses focus. To see this\nfeature in action: select an option with up/down arrows, then click outside the input:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    label=\"Your favorite library:\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n    autoSelectOnBlur=True,\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### Searchable\n\nSet `searchable=True` to allow filtering options by user input.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    searchable=True,\n    w=200,\n)\n```\n### clearSearchOnFocus\n\nWhen `clearSearchOnFocus=True` and the `Select` is in searchable mode, the search input will be cleared each time the\nfield gains focus.  This is useful when you want the user to start with an empty search box each time, without having \nto manually delete the existing text.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    value=\"Pandas\",\n    searchable=True,\n    clearSearchOnFocus=True,\n)\n```\n### Nothing Found\n\nSet the `nothingFoundMessage` prop to display a given message when no options match the search query or there is \nno data available. If the `nothingFoundMessage` prop is not set, the `MultiSelect` dropdown will be hidden.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    label=\"Pick your favorite library\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    searchable=True,\n    nothingFoundMessage=\"Nothing found...\",\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### Checked option icon\nSet `checkIconPosition` prop to left or right to control position of check icon in active option. To remove the \ncheck icon, set `withCheckIcon=False`.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    label=\"Control check icon\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    value=\"NumPy\",\n    checkIconPosition=\"right\",\n    dropdownOpened=True,\n    comboboxProps={\"withinPortal\":False},\n    w=200,\n    pb=150,\n    id=\"select-check-icon\",\n\n)\n```\n### Clearable\n\nSet `clearable` prop to enable clearing selected values.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    value=\"Pandas\",\n    clearable=True,\n    w=200,\n)\n```\n### Allow deselect\n`allowDeselect` prop determines whether the value should be deselected when user clicks on the selected option. By \ndefault, `allowDeselect` is True:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Paper(\n    [\n        dmc.Select(\n            label=\"Option cannot be deselected\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n            value=\"Pandas\",\n            allowDeselect=False,\n            w=400,\n        ),\n        dmc.Select(\n            label=\"Option can be deselected\",\n            description=\"This is the default behavior, click 'Pandas' in the dropdown\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n            value=\"Pandas\",\n            allowDeselect=True,\n            w=400,\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Large Data Sets\n\nThe best strategy for large data sets is to limit the number of options that are rendered at the same time. You can\ndo it with limit prop. \n\nNote that if you use a custom `filter` function, you need to implement your own logic to limit the number of options in filter\n\nExample of `Select` with 100 000 options, 10 options are rendered at the same time:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    label=\"100,000 options\",\n    data=[f\"Option {i}\" for i in range(100000)],\n    placeholder=\"use limit to optimize performance\",\n    limit=10,\n    searchable=True,\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### renderOption\n\n`renderOption` function allows you to customize option rendering.\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = ([\n    dmc.Select(\n      label=\"Select with renderOption\",\n      placeholder=\"Select text align\",\n      data=[\n        { \"value\": 'left', \"label\": 'Left' },\n        { \"value\": 'center', \"label\": 'Center' },\n        { \"value\": 'right', \"label\": 'Right' },\n        { \"value\": 'justify', \"label\": 'Justify' },\n      ],\n      renderOption={\"function\": \"renderOptionSelect\"}\n    )\n\n])\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\nvar dmc = window.dash_mantine_components;\nvar iconify = window.dash_iconify;\n\n\ndmcfuncs.renderOptionSelect = function ({ option, checked }) {\n\n  const icons = {\n   left: React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, { icon: \"mdi:format-align-left\", width: 24 }),\n   center: React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, { icon: \"mdi:format-align-center\", width: 24 }),\n   right: React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, { icon: \"mdi:format-align-right\", width: 24 }),\n   justify: React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, { icon: \"mdi:format-align-justify\", width: 24 }),\n  };\n\n  const checkedIcon = React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, {\n    icon: \"mdi:check\",\n    width: 24,\n  });\n\n  return React.createElement(\n    dmc.Group,\n    { flex: \"1\", gap: \"xs\" },\n    icons[option.value],\n    option.label,\n    checked ? checkedIcon : null\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Options filtering\n\nBy default, `Select` filters options by checking if the option label contains input value. You can change this behavior \nwith `filter`. The filter function receives an object with the following properties as a single argument:\n - `options` – array of options or options groups, all options are in `{ value: string; label: string; disabled?: boolean }` format\n - `search` – current search query\n - `limit` – value of limit prop passed to `Select`\n\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\nExample of a custom filter function that matches options by words instead of letters sequence:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    label=\"Your country\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n    searchable=True,\n    data=[\n        \"Great Britain\",\n        \"Canada\",\n        \"United States\",\n    ],\n    filter={\"function\": \"filterCountries\"},\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.filterCountries = function ({ options, search }) {\n  const queryWords = search.toLowerCase().trim().split(\" \");\n  return options.filter((option) => {\n    const words = option.label.toLowerCase().trim().split(\" \");\n    return queryWords.every((word) =>\n      words.some((labelWord) => labelWord.includes(word))\n    );\n  });\n};\n```\n\n\n### Sort options\n\nBy default, options are sorted by their position in the data array. You can change this behavior with `filter` function:\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    label=\"Your favorite Python library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n    searchable=True,\n    nothingFoundMessage=\"Nothing found...\",\n    data=[\n        \"4 – NumPy\",\n        \"1 – Pandas\",\n        \"3 – Scikit-learn\",\n        \"2 – Plotly\",\n    ],\n    filter={\"function\": \"filterPythonLibs\"},\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.filterPythonLibs = function ({ options, search }) {\n  const query = search.toLowerCase().trim();\n  const result = options.filter((option) =>\n    option.label.toLowerCase().trim().includes(query)\n  );\n  result.sort((a, b) => a.label.localeCompare(b.label));\n  return result;\n};\n```\n\n\n\n### Scrollable dropdown\n\nBy default, the options list is wrapped with `ScrollArea.Autosize`. You can control dropdown max-height with \n`maxDropdownHeight` prop if you do not change the default settings.\n\nIf you want to use native scrollbars, set `withScrollArea=False`. Note that in this case, you will need to change \ndropdown styles with `Styles API`.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Paper(\n    [\n        dmc.Select(\n            label=\"Scrollable dropdown\",\n            data=[f\"Option {i}\" for i in range(100)],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n            maxDropdownHeight=300,\n            w=400,\n        ),\n        dmc.Select(\n            label=\"With native scroll\",\n            data=[f\"Option {i}\" for i in range(100)],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n            withScrollArea=False,\n            styles={\"dropdown\": {\"maxHeight\": 200, \"overflowY\": \"auto\"}},\n            w=400,\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Grouping Items\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    data=[\n        {\n            \"group\": \"Data Analysis\",\n            \"items\": [\n                {\"value\": \"Pandas\", \"label\": \"Pandas\"},\n                {\"value\": \"NumPy\", \"label\": \"NumPy\"},\n            ],\n        },\n        {\n            \"group\": \"Deep Learning\",\n            \"items\": [\n                {\"value\": \"TensorFlow\", \"label\": \"TensorFlow\"},\n                {\"value\": \"PyTorch\", \"label\": \"PyTorch\"},\n            ],\n        },\n    ],\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### Combobox props\nYou can override `Combobox` props with `comboboxProps`. It is useful when you need to change some of the props that are\nnot exposed by `Select`, for example `withinPortal`:\n\n```python\ndmc.Select(comboboxProps={\"withinPortal\": False})\n```\n\n\n### Change dropdown z-index\n\n\n```python\ndmc.Select(comboboxProps={\"zIndex\": 1000})\n```\n\n### Inside Popover\n\nTo use `Select` inside popover, you need to set `withinPortal=False`:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Popover(\n    width=300,\n    position=\"bottom\",\n    withArrow=True,\n    shadow=\"md\",\n    children=[\n        dmc.PopoverTarget(dmc.Button(\"Toggle Popover\")),\n        dmc.PopoverDropdown(\n            dmc.Select(\n                label=\"Your favorite library\",\n                placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n                data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n                comboboxProps={\"withinPortal\": False},\n            )\n        ),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Dropdown open in a callback\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, html, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Toggle dropdown\", id=\"btn-select-opened\", n_clicks=0),\n        dmc.Select(\n            label=\"Select your favorite library\",\n            placeholder=\"Select value\",\n            id=\"select-opened\",\n            value=\"pd\",\n            data=[\n                {\"value\": \"pd\", \"label\": \"Pandas\"},\n                {\"value\": \"np\", \"label\": \"NumPy\"},\n                {\"value\": \"tf\", \"label\": \"TensorFlow\"},\n                {\"value\": \"torch\", \"label\": \"PyTorch\"},\n            ],\n            comboboxProps={\"position\": \"bottom\", \"middlewares\": {\"flip\": False, \"shift\": False}},\n            w=400,\n            mb=10,\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"select-opened\", \"dropdownOpened\"), Input(\"btn-select-opened\", \"n_clicks\")\n)\ndef select_value(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    return True\n```\n### Dropdown position\n\nBy default, the dropdown is displayed below the input if there is enough space; otherwise it is displayed above the\ninput. You can change this behavior by setting `position` and `middlewares` props, which are passed down to the\nunderlying `Popover` component.\n\nExample of dropdown that is always displayed above the input:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    label=\"Your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\"position\": \"top\", \"middlewares\": {\"flip\": False, \"shift\": False}},\n)\n```\n### Dropdown width\n\nTo change dropdown width, set `width` prop in `comboboxProps`. By default, dropdown width is equal to the input width.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    label=\"Your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\"position\": \"bottom-start\", \"width\": 200},\n)\n```\n### Dropdown offset\n\nTo change dropdown offset, set `offset` prop in `comboboxProps`:  \n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    label=\"Your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\n        \"position\": \"bottom\",\n        \"middlewares\": {\"flip\": False, \"shift\": False},\n        \"offset\": 0,\n    },\n)\n```\n### Dropdown animation\nBy default, dropdown animations are disabled. To enable them, you can set `transitionProps`, which will be passed\ndown to the underlying `Transition` component.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    label=\"Your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick values\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\"transitionProps\": {\"transition\": \"pop\", \"duration\": 200}},\n)\n```\n### Dropdown padding\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Paper(\n    [\n        dmc.Select(\n            label=\"Zero padding\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n            comboboxProps={\"dropdownPadding\": 0},\n            w=400,\n        ),\n        dmc.Select(\n            label=\"10px padding\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n            comboboxProps={\"dropdownPadding\": 10},\n            w=400,\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Dropdown shadow\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    label=\"Your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\"shadow\": \"md\"},\n)\n```\n### Left and right sections\n\n`Select` supports `leftSection` and `rightSection` props. These sections are rendered with absolute position\ninside the input wrapper. You can use them to display icons, input controls or any other elements.\n\nYou can use the following props to control sections styles and content:\n\n- `rightSection`/`leftSection` – component to render on the corresponding side of input\n- `rightSectionWidth`/`leftSectionWidth` – controls width of the right section and padding on the corresponding side of the input. By default, it is controlled by component size prop.\n- `rightSectionPointerEvents`/`leftSectionPointerEvents` – controls pointer-events property of the section. If you want to render a non-interactive element, set it to none to pass clicks through to the input.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Paper(\n    [\n        dmc.Select(\n            label=\"Your favorite library\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick values\",\n            leftSectionPointerEvents=\"none\",\n            leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"bi-book\"),\n            w=400,\n        ),\n        dmc.Select(\n            label=\"Your favorite library\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick values\",\n            rightSectionPointerEvents=\"none\",\n            rightSection=DashIconify(icon=\"bi-book\"),\n            w=400,\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Input Props\n`Select` component supports `Input` and Input Wrapper components features and all input element props.\n`Select` documentation does not include all features supported by the component – see Input documentation to learn about all available features.\n\n \n### Invalid State And Error\n\n\nNote: Dash adds some css by default which can lead you to see a red box when setting the `required` or `error` \nprop to True. Use the below css snippet to counteract it.\n\n```css\ninput:invalid {\n    outline: none !important;\n}\n```\n\nYou can let the user know if the selected value is invalid. In the example below, you will get an error message if you\nselect less than 2 currency pairs.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, callback\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    data=[\"USDINR\", \"EURUSD\", \"USDTWD\", \"USDJPY\"],\n    id=\"select-error\",\n    value=\"USDJPY\",\n    w=200,\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"select-error\", \"error\"), Input(\"select-error\", \"value\"))\ndef select_value(value):\n    return \"JPY is not allowed!\" if value == \"USDJPY\" else \"\"\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n| Name        | Static selector             | Description                                      |\n|:------------|:----------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|\n| wrapper     | .mantine-Select-wrapper     | Root element of the Input                        |\n| input       | .mantine-Select-input       | Input element                                    |\n| section     | .mantine-Select-section     | Left and right sections                          |\n| root        | .mantine-Select-root        | Root element                                     |\n| label       | .mantine-Select-label       | Label element                                    |\n| required    | .mantine-Select-required    | Required asterisk element, rendered inside label |\n| description | .mantine-Select-description | Description element                              |\n| error       | .mantine-Select-error       | Error element                                    |\n| dropdown    | .mantine-Select-dropdown    | Dropdown root element                            |\n| options     | .mantine-Select-options     | Options wrapper                                  |\n| option      | .mantine-Select-option      | Option                                           |\n| empty       | .mantine-Select-empty       | Nothing found message                            |\n| group       | .mantine-Select-group       | Options group wrapper                            |\n| groupLabel  | .mantine-Select-groupLabel  | Options group label                              |\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### Select\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- allowDeselect (boolean; optional):\n    Determines whether it should be possible to deselect value by\n    clicking on the selected option, `True` by default.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

If you need more advanced behavior or want to extend\nits functionality, you can create your own custom `TagsInput` component.  See this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dmc_custom_components) for custom DMC component examples.\n\n\n\n### Simple Example\n\n`TagsInput` provides a way to enter multiple values. It can be used with suggestions or without them.\n`TagsInput` is similar to MultiSelect, but it allows entering custom values.\n\nBy default, `enter key` and `,` will select the typed value.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, html, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.TagsInput(\n            label=\"Select frameworks\",\n            placeholder=\"Select all you like!\",\n            id=\"framework-tags-input\",\n            value=[\"ng\", \"vue\"],\n            w=400,\n            mb=10,\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"tags-input-value\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"tags-input-value\", \"children\"), Input(\"framework-tags-input\", \"value\")\n)\ndef select_value(value):\n    return \", \".join(value)\n```\n### Data Format\n\nNote that the `data` format is different than components like `Select` and `Multi Select`.  See [Why can I not use value/label data structure with TagsInput?](https://help.mantine.dev/q/autocomplete-value-label)\n\n`TagsInput` `data` prop accepts data in one of the following formats:\n\n```python\ndata = [\"React\", \"Angular\", \"Svelte\", \"Vue\"]\n\n# or\n\ndata = [\n    {\"group\": \"Frontend\", \"items\": [\"React\", \"Angular\"]},\n    {\"group\": \"Backend\", \"items\": [\"Express\", \"Django\"]}\n]\n```\n\n### Clearable\n\nSet `clearable` prop to display the clear button in the right section. The button is not displayed when:\n\n* The component does not have a value\n* The component is disabled\n* The component is read only\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    label=\"Press Enter to submit a tag\",\n    value=[\"React\"],\n    w=400,\n    clearable=True,\n)\n```\n### Max selected values\n\nYou can limit the number of selected values with `maxTags` prop. This will not allow adding more values once the limit is reached.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    label=\"Select frameworks\",\n    description=\"You can select a maximum of 3 frameworks.\",\n    maxTags=3,\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### Accept value on blur\nBy default, if the user types a value and blurs the input, the value is added to the list. You can change this behavior\nby setting `acceptValueOnBlur` to `False`. In this case, the value is added only when the user presses `Enter` or clicks\non a suggestion.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, html, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.TagsInput(\n            label=\"Value is accepted on blur\",\n            placeholder=\"Select all you like!\",\n            id=\"framework-tags-input1\",\n            value=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\"],\n            w=400,\n            mb=10,\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"tags-input-value1\", mb=\"xl\"),\n        dmc.TagsInput(\n            label=\"Value IS NOT accepted on blur\",\n            placeholder=\"Select all you like!\",\n            id=\"framework-tags-input2\",\n            value=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\"],\n            acceptValueOnBlur=False,\n            w=400,\n            mb=10,\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"tags-input-value2\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"tags-input-value1\", \"children\"), Input(\"framework-tags-input1\", \"value\")\n)\ndef select_value(value):\n    return f\"You selected {value}\"\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"tags-input-value2\", \"children\"), Input(\"framework-tags-input2\", \"value\")\n)\ndef select_value(value):\n    return f\"You selected {value}\"\n```\n### Allow duplicates\n\nBy default, `TagsInput` does not allow adding duplicate values, but you can change this behavior by setting `allowDuplicates` prop.\nValue is considered duplicate if it is already present in the `value` array, regardless of the case and trailing whitespace.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    label=\"Press Enter to submit a tag\",\n    placeholder=\"Duplicates are allowed\",\n    allowDuplicates=True,\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### Split chars\n\nBy default, `TagsInput` splits values by comma (`,`), but you can change this behavior by setting `splitChars` prop to an array of strings.\nAll values from `splitChars` cannot be included in the final value. Values are also split on paste.\n\nExample of splitting by `,`, `|` and `space`:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    label=\"Press Enter to submit a tag\",\n    placeholder=\"Enter tag\",\n    splitChars=[\",\", \" \", \"|\"],\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### With suggestions\n\n`TagsInput` can be used with suggestions, it will render suggestions list under input and allow selecting suggestions \nwith keyboard or mouse. Note that user is not limited to suggestions, it is still possible to enter custom values. \nIf you want to allow values only from suggestions, use [MultiSelect](/components/multiselect) component instead.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    w=400,\n    label=\"Press Enter to submit a tag\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick tag from list\",\n    data=[\"React\", \"Angular\", \"Svelte\"],\n)\n```\n### Grouping\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    data=[\n        {\n            \"group\": \"Data Analysis\",\n            \"items\": [\n                {\"value\": \"Pandas\", \"label\": \"Pandas\"},\n                {\"value\": \"NumPy\", \"label\": \"NumPy\"},\n            ],\n        },\n        {\n            \"group\": \"Deep Learning\",\n            \"items\": [\n                {\"value\": \"TensorFlow\", \"label\": \"TensorFlow\"},\n                {\"value\": \"PyTorch\", \"label\": \"PyTorch\"},\n            ],\n        },\n    ],\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### Large data sets\nThe best strategy for large data sets is to limit the number of options that are rendered at the same time. You can do\nit with `limit` prop. \n\nExample of `TagsInput` with 100 000 options, 5 options are rendered at the same time:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    label=\"100,000 options\",\n    data=[f\"Option {i}\" for i in range(100000)],\n    placeholder=\"use limit to optimize performance\",\n    limit=5,\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### renderOption\n\n`renderOption` function allows you to customize option rendering.\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ngroceries = {\n    \"Apples\": {\n        \"emoji\": \"🍎\",\n        \"description\": \"Crisp and juicy snacking delight\",\n    },\n    \"Bread\": {\n        \"emoji\": \"🍞\",\n        \"description\": \"Freshly baked daily essential\",\n    },\n    \"Bananas\": {\n        \"emoji\": \"🍌\",\n        \"description\": \"Perfect for a healthy breakfast\",\n    },\n    \"Eggs\": {\n        \"emoji\": \"🥚\",\n        \"description\": \"Versatile protein source for cooking\",\n    },\n    \"Broccoli\": {\n        \"emoji\": \"🥦\",\n        \"description\": \"Nutrient-rich green vegetable\",\n    },\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    label=\"Groceries\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick tag from list or type to add new\",\n    data=list(groceries.keys()),\n    maxDropdownHeight=300,\n    renderOption={\n        \"function\": \"renderGroceryOption\",\n        \"options\": {\"data\": groceries},\n    },\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\nvar dmc = window.dash_mantine_components;\n\ndmcfuncs.renderGroceryOption = function ({ option }, { data }) {\n  const item = data[option.value];\n\n  return React.createElement(\n    dmc.Group,\n    null,\n    React.createElement(\n      dmc.Text,\n      { span: true, fz: 24 },\n      item.emoji\n    ),\n    React.createElement(\n      \"div\",\n      null,\n      React.createElement(dmc.Text, { key: \"label\"}, option.value, ),\n      React.createElement(\n        dmc.Text,\n        { size: \"xs\", opacity: 0.5, key: \"description\" },\n        item.description\n      )\n    )\n  );\n};\n```\n\n\n### Options filtering\n\nBy default, `TagsInput` filters options by checking if the option label contains input value. You can change this behavior \nwith `filter`. The filter function receives an object with the following properties as a single argument:\n - `options` – array of options or options groups, all options are in `{ value: string; label: string; disabled?: boolean }` format\n - `search` – current search query\n - `limit` – value of limit prop passed to `Select`\n\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\nExample of a custom filter function that matches options by words instead of letters sequence:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    label=\"What countries have you visited?\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n    data=[\n        \"Great Britain\",\n        \"Canada\",\n        \"United States\",\n    ],\n    filter={\"function\": \"filterCountries\"},\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.filterCountries = function ({ options, search }) {\n  const queryWords = search.toLowerCase().trim().split(\" \");\n  return options.filter((option) => {\n    const words = option.label.toLowerCase().trim().split(\" \");\n    return queryWords.every((word) =>\n      words.some((labelWord) => labelWord.includes(word))\n    );\n  });\n};\n```\n\n\n### Sort options\n\nBy default, options are sorted by their position in the data array. You can change this behavior with `filter` function:\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    label=\"Your favorite Python library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n    data=[\n        \"4 – NumPy\",\n        \"1 – Pandas\",\n        \"3 – Scikit-learn\",\n        \"2 – Plotly\",\n    ],\n    filter={\"function\": \"filterPythonLibs\"},\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.filterPythonLibs = function ({ options, search }) {\n  const query = search.toLowerCase().trim();\n  const result = options.filter((option) =>\n    option.label.toLowerCase().trim().includes(query)\n  );\n  result.sort((a, b) => a.label.localeCompare(b.label));\n  return result;\n};\n```\n\n\n\n\n### Scrollable dropdown\n\nBy default, the options list is wrapped with `ScrollArea.Autosize`. You can control dropdown max-height with \n`maxDropdownHeight` prop if you do not change the default settings.\n\nIf you want to use native scrollbars, set `withScrollArea=False`. Note that in this case, you will need to change \ndropdown styles with `Styles API`.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Paper(\n    [\n        dmc.TagsInput(\n            label=\"Scrollable dropdown\",\n            data=[f\"Option {i}\" for i in range(100)],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n            maxDropdownHeight=300,\n            w=400,\n        ),\n        dmc.TagsInput(\n            label=\"With native scroll\",\n            data=[f\"Option {i}\" for i in range(100)],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n            withScrollArea=False,\n            styles={\"dropdown\": {\"maxHeight\": 200, \"overflowY\": \"auto\"}},\n            w=400,\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Disabled options  \n\nWhen an option is disabled, it cannot be selected and is ignored in keyboard navigation. Note that user can still enter\ndisabled option as a value. If you want to prohibit certain values, use a callback to filter them out.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    label=\"Enter tags\",\n    placeholder=\"Some tags are disabled\",\n    data = [\n        {\"value\": \"Pandas\"},\n        {\"value\": \"NumPy\"},\n        {\"value\": \"TensorFlow\", \"disabled\": True},\n        {\"value\": \"PyTorch\", \"disabled\": True},\n    ],\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### Combobox props\nYou can override `Combobox` props with `comboboxProps`. It is useful when you need to change some of the props that are\nnot exposed by `TagsInput`, for example `withinPortal`:\n\n```python\ndmc.TagsInput(comboboxProps={\"withinPortal\": False})\n```\n\n\n### Change dropdown z-index\n\n```python\ndmc.TagsInput(comboboxProps={\"zIndex\": 1000})\n```\n\n### Inside Popover\n\nTo use `TagsInput` inside popover, you need to set `withinPortal=False`:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Popover(\n    width=300,\n    position=\"bottom\",\n    withArrow=True,\n    shadow=\"md\",\n    children=[\n        dmc.PopoverTarget(dmc.Button(\"Toggle Popover\")),\n        dmc.PopoverDropdown(\n            dmc.TagsInput(\n                label=\"Your favorite library\",\n                placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n                data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n                comboboxProps={\"withinPortal\": False},\n            )\n        ),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Dropdown open in a callback\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, html, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Toggle dropdown\", id=\"btn-tags-opened\", n_clicks=0),\n        dmc.TagsInput(\n            label=\"Select your favorite library\",\n            placeholder=\"Select value\",\n            id=\"tags-opened\",\n            value=[\"pd\"],\n            data=[\n                {\"value\": \"pd\", \"label\": \"Pandas\"},\n                {\"value\": \"np\", \"label\": \"NumPy\"},\n                {\"value\": \"tf\", \"label\": \"TensorFlow\"},\n                {\"value\": \"torch\", \"label\": \"PyTorch\"},\n            ],\n            w=400,\n            mb=10,\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"tags-opened\", \"dropdownOpened\"), Input(\"btn-tags-opened\", \"n_clicks\")\n)\ndef select_value(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    return True\n```\n### Dropdown position\n\nBy default, the dropdown is displayed below the input if there is enough space; otherwise it is displayed above the\ninput. You can change this behavior by setting `position` and `middlewares` props, which are passed down to the\nunderlying `Popover` component.\n\nExample of dropdown that is always displayed above the input:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    label=\"Your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\"position\": \"top\", \"middlewares\": {\"flip\": False, \"shift\": False}},\n)\n```\n### Dropdown width\n\nTo change dropdown width, set `width` prop in `comboboxProps`. By default, dropdown width is equal to the input width.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    label=\"Your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\"position\": \"bottom-start\", \"width\": 200},\n)\n```\n### Dropdown offset\n\nTo change dropdown offset, set `offset` prop in `comboboxProps`:  \n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    label=\"Your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\n        \"position\": \"bottom\",\n        \"middlewares\": {\"flip\": False, \"shift\": False},\n        \"offset\": 0,\n    },\n)\n```\n### Dropdown animation\nBy default, dropdown animations are disabled. To enable them, you can set `transitionProps`, which will be passed\ndown to the underlying `Transition` component.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    label=\"Your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick values\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\"transitionProps\": {\"transition\": \"pop\", \"duration\": 200}},\n)\n```\n### Dropdown padding\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Paper(\n    [\n        dmc.TagsInput(\n            label=\"Zero padding\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n            comboboxProps={\"dropdownPadding\": 0},\n            w=400,\n        ),\n        dmc.TagsInput(\n            label=\"10px padding\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n            comboboxProps={\"dropdownPadding\": 10},\n            w=400,\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Dropdown shadow\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    label=\"Your favorite library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    comboboxProps={\"shadow\": \"md\"},\n)\n```\n### Left and right sections\n\n`MultiSelect` supports `leftSection` and `rightSection` props. These sections are rendered with absolute position\ninside the input wrapper. You can use them to display icons, input controls or any other elements.\n\nYou can use the following props to control sections styles and content:\n\n- `rightSection`/`leftSection` – component to render on the corresponding side of input\n- `rightSectionWidth`/`leftSectionWidth` – controls width of the right section and padding on the corresponding side of the input. By default, it is controlled by component size prop.\n- `rightSectionPointerEvents`/`leftSectionPointerEvents` – controls pointer-events property of the section. If you want to render a non-interactive element, set it to none to pass clicks through to the input.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Paper(\n    [\n        dmc.TagsInput(\n            label=\"Your favorite library\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick values\",\n            leftSectionPointerEvents=\"none\",\n            leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"bi-book\"),\n            w=400,\n        ),\n        dmc.TagsInput(\n            label=\"Your favorite library\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            placeholder=\"Pick values\",\n            rightSectionPointerEvents=\"none\",\n            rightSection=DashIconify(icon=\"bi-book\"),\n            w=400,\n            mt=\"md\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Input Props\n`TagsInput` component supports `Input` and Input Wrapper components features and all input element props.\n`TagsInput` documentation does not include all features supported by the component – see Input documentation to learn about all available features.\n\n \n### Read only\nSet `readOnly` to make the input read only. When `readOnly` is set, `TagsInput` will not show suggestions and value\ncannot be updated by the user entering data in the input.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    label=\"Read only\",\n    placeholder=\"Enter tag\",\n    readOnly=True,\n    value=[\"First\", \"Second\"],\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### Disabled\nSet `disabled` to disable the input. When `disabled` is set, user cannot interact with the input and `TagsInput` will not show suggestions.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TagsInput(\n    label=\"Disabled\",\n    disabled=True,\n    value=[\"First\", \"Second\"],\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\nRefer to the Mantine TagsInput Style API [interactive demo](https://mantine.dev/core/tags-input/#styles-api) for help in identifying each selector.\n\n\n| Name        | Static selector                | Description                                      |\n|:------------|:-------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|\n| wrapper     | .mantine-TagsInput-wrapper     | Root element of the Input                        |\n| input       | .mantine-TagsInput-input       | Input element                                    |\n| section     | .mantine-TagsInput-section     | Left and right sections                          |\n| root        | .mantine-TagsInput-root        | Root element                                     |\n| label       | .mantine-TagsInput-label       | Label element                                    |\n| required    | .mantine-TagsInput-required    | Required asterisk element, rendered inside label |\n| description | .mantine-TagsInput-description | Description element                              |\n| error       | .mantine-TagsInput-error       | Error element                                    |\n| dropdown    | .mantine-TagsInput-dropdown    | Dropdown root element                            |\n| options     | .mantine-TagsInput-options     | Options wrapper                                  |\n| option      | .mantine-TagsInput-option      | Option                                           |\n| empty       | .mantine-TagsInput-empty       | Nothing found message                            |\n| group       | .mantine-TagsInput-group       | Options group wrapper                            |\n| groupLabel  | .mantine-TagsInput-groupLabel  | Options group label                              |\n| pill        | .mantine-TagsInput-pill        | Value pill                                       |\n| inputField  | .mantine-TagsInput-inputField  | Input field                                      |\n| pillsList   | .mantine-TagsInput-pillsList   | List of pills, also contains input field         |\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### TagsInput\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- acceptValueOnBlur (boolean; optional):\n    Determines whether the value typed in by the user but not\n    submitted should be accepted when the input is blurred, True by\n    default.\n\n- allowDuplicates (boolean; optional):\n    Determines whether duplicate tags are allowed, `False` by default.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

This enables a wide range of custom components, such as building advanced `Select`\nor `MultiSelect` on top of Mantine’s [Combobox](https://mantine.dev/core/combobox/), while keeping theme and behavior consistent inside a Dash app.\n\nFor examples and step-by-step instructions, see the custom DMC components in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dmc_custom_components)."

    "endpoint": "/dash4-components",
    "category": "Dash",
    "content": "\n\n## Dash 4 Components  \nStyle Dash 4 Core Components with a Mantine theme  \nCategory: Dash  \n\nDash 4 completely redesigned its core components for a consistent look and feel and added many new features. Components \nlike `dcc.Slider` and `dcc.Dropdown` now include functionality not available in DMC, making them useful to mix into your\napp when needed.  This section shows how to style Dash 4 components to match a Mantine theme in light and dark mode.\n\n\n### Dash 4 Accent Color\n\nThe accent for Dash 4 components is controlled by a CSS variable so it's easy to change. The value can be any valid CSS color.\n\nThis example changes the default purple color to your Mantine primary color:\n\n```python\nstyle={\n    \"--Dash-Fill-Interactive-Strong\": \"var(--mantine-primary-color-filled)\"\n}\n```\n\n\n### Dark Mode Support\n\nDash 4 components do not include built-in dark mode support. You can enable light and dark mode by mapping Dash CSS\nvariables to Mantine theme variables.\n\nAdd the following CSS to `assets/`:\n\n```css\n.dmc {\n    --Dash-Stroke-Strong: var(--mantine-color-default-border);\n    --Dash-Stroke-Weak: var(--mantine-color-disabled);\n    --Dash-Fill-Interactive-Strong: var(--mantine-primary-color-filled);\n    --Dash-Fill-Inverse-Strong: var(--mantine-color-body);\n    --Dash-Text-Primary: var(--mantine-color-text);\n    --Dash-Text-Strong: var(--mantine-color-text);\n    --Dash-Text-Disabled: var(--mantine-color-dimmed);\n    --Dash-Text-Weak: var(--mantine-color-dimmed);\n}\n\n:root[data-mantine-color-scheme=\"dark\"] .dmc {\n    --Dash-Fill-Inverse-Strong: var(--mantine-color-dark-6);\n    --Dash-Fill-Weak: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.06);\n    --Dash-Fill-Primary-Hover: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08);\n    --Dash-Fill-Primary-Active: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12);\n    --Dash-Fill-Disabled: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15);\n}\n```\n\nWrap your app layout with  `dmc` class:\n\n```python\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    dmc.Container(\n        [...],\n        className=\"dmc\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\nDash 4 components inside this container will follow the Mantine color scheme and update automatically when the theme changes.\n\n\n### Example 1: dcc.Dropdown\n\nThis example shows how a `dcc.Dropdown` works well with other DMC inputs in grids or forms.\n\nThe Dash 4 `dcc.Dropdown` supports virtualization, which renders only the visible options instead of the entire list.\nThis improves performance and responsiveness when working with large data sets. It also includes a search input and\nSelect all / Deselect all buttons inside the dropdown menu. When `multi=True`, it displays a count of selected items,\npreventing the input from resizing as selections grow.\n\nThe `dmc.InputWrapper` is used to add elements like `label`, `description`, and `error` to the `dcc.Dropdown`,\nmaking it consistent with the other DMC inputs. The `htmlFor` prop links the label to the component for focus and accessibility.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import dcc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Card([\n    dmc.SimpleGrid(\n        [\n            dmc.InputWrapper(\n                dcc.Dropdown([f\"option {i}\" for i in range(100)],  value=[\"option 1\", \"option 2\", \"option 3\"], multi=True, id=\"dcc-dropdown\"),\n                label=\"dcc.Dropdown with a dmc.InputWrapper\",\n                htmlFor=\"dcc-dropdown\"\n            ),\n            dmc.NumberInput(\n                label=\"dmc.NumberInput\",\n                value=30712,\n                thousandSeparator=True,\n                prefix=\"$ \",\n\n            ),\n            dmc.DatePickerInput(label=\"dmc.DatePickerInput\", value=\"2025-12-05\"),\n        ],\n        cols={\"base\": 1, \"md\": 3},\n    ),\n    ],\n    withBorder=True,\n    shadow=\"sm\",\n    radius=\"md\",\n    p=\"md\",\n    className=\"dmc\"  # applies Mantine styles\n)\n```\n### Example 2: dcc.Slider\n\nThe `dcc.Slider` includes optional numeric input fields and automatic mark generation based on range and width.  There is\nalso an option for a vertical slider.\n\nThis example shows the `dcc.Slider` styled with a Mantine theme.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import dcc\n\ncomponent = dcc.RangeSlider(0, 200, value=[50, 150], className=\"dmc\")\n```\n### Migrating to Dash v4\n\nAll component props remain unchanged, so upgrading should not introduce errors. You may notice layout and style differences due to the redesign.\n\nCustom CSS written for Dash 3 components will not apply to Dash 4. The components were fully rewritten, so selectors have changed. Start with the styling approach shown here and customize as needed for your app."

Learn how to apply light and dark grid themes and use DMC components as custom cell renderers and editors.  \nCategory: Dash  \n\n### Dash AG Grid quickstart\n\nIf you're new to Dash AG Grid, check out the [official Dash AG Grid documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-ag-grid) for detailed information.\n\nHere are just some of the features enabled by default in the quickstart example below:\n\n* Built-in theme pairs well with the Mantine default theme\n* Columns are resizable (drag the column header edges)\n* Rows are sortable (click header; shift-click for multi-sort)\n* Smooth row animations during filtering and sorting\n* Boolean values are rendered as checkboxes\n* Columns can be reordered by dragging\n* Columns can be pinned to either side of the grid\n\n\n\n### Quickstart Demo\n\n```bash\npip install dash-ag-grid\n\n```\n\n---\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nimport dash_ag_grid as dag\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom dash import Dash\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/ag-grid/space-mission-data.csv\")\n\napp = Dash()\n\ncomponent = dag.AgGrid(\n    rowData=df.to_dict(\"records\"),\n    columnDefs=[{\"field\": i} for i in df.columns],\n)\n\napp.layout=dmc.MantineProvider(component)\n\napp.run(debug=True)\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Explore More Grid Features\n\nBe sure to check out the [Dash AG Grid documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-ag-grid) for even more features, such as:\n\n- Column: resizing, reordering, pinning, spanning, and grouping.\n- Row: sorting, selection (including with checkboxes), reordering, dragging, spanning, pinned rows, and full width rows.\n- Data Manipulation and Display: pagination, cell data types with automatic inference, custom filtering, and cell editing,  value getters and formatters, conditional formatting, and CSV data export.\n- Layout and Styling:  themes (Alpine, Material, Quartz) with light/dark options, customizable themes, and conditional styling for various elements. Custom icons and more.\n- Other Features: tooltips in cells and headers, keyboard navigation, accessibility support, and localization. \n- Enterprise Features:  All the above features are free in AG Grid Community.  Additional advanced features are available with an AG Grid Enterprise licence.\n\nThe next sections show how to apply AG Grid themes that match your Mantine light or dark theme, and how to use DMC\ncomponents as custom cell renderers and editors. \n\n\n### Theming: Light and Dark Mode\n\n#### Dash AG Grid ≥ v33\n\nDash AG Grid v33+ introduced a new theming API that makes it much easier to style the grid.\n\nMore details and examples are available in the [dash-ag-grid documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-ag-grid/styling-themes).\nIf you are upgrading from an earlier version, see the [migration guide](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-ag-grid/migration-guide).\n\nIn earlier versions of dash-ag-grid, the grid theme was set using the `className` prop. Switching between light and\ndark mode typically required updating `className` in a callback, which caused the grid to re-render and often resulted\nin visible lag.\n\nWith v33+, the same built-in themes are still available, but they are applied through the new `theme` API instead\nof `className`. Theme values can be customized using any valid CSS values, and using CSS variables works well for light and\ndark mode support.  See also the [Ag Grid documentation](https://www.ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/theming-colors/) for more information.\n\nBelow are two simple examples.\n\nExample 1: No callback\n\nThis example uses a built-in light theme and applies Mantine CSS variables for background and text colors. When the app \ntheme changes, the grid updates automatically. No callback is required.\n\n```python\n# dash-ag-grid >= 33.3.3\nimport dash_ag_grid as dag\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/ag-grid/olympic-winners.csv\")\n\ntheme =  {\n    \"function\": (\n        \"themeQuartz.withParams({\"        \n           \"backgroundColor: 'var(--mantine-color-body)', \"\n           \"foregroundColor: 'var(--mantine-color-text)', \"\n        \"})\"\n    )\n}\n\ncomponent = dag.AgGrid(\n    rowData=df.to_dict(\"records\"),\n    columnDefs=[{\"field\": i} for i in [\"athlete\", \"country\", \"sport\", \"year\"]],\n    defaultColDef={\"flex\": 1, \"filter\": True},\n    dashGridOptions={\n        \"theme\": theme,\n        \"rowSelection\": {\"mode\": \"multiRow\"}\n    },\n)\n```\nExample 2: Callback to switch built-in theme\n\nBecause the first example is based on a light theme, some elements such as scrollbars may not appear correctly in dark mode.\n\nThis example switches between the light and dark variants of the built-in Quartz theme. It also demonstrates additional\ncustomization using the `theme` prop to set fonts and accent colors.\n\n```python\n# dash-ag-grid >= 33.3.3\nimport dash_ag_grid as dag\nfrom dash import clientside_callback, Input, Output, html\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/ag-grid/olympic-winners.csv\")\n\ntheme =  {\n    \"function\": (\n        \"themeQuartz.withParams({\"        \n        \"accentColor: 'var(--mantine-primary-color-filled)', \"\n        \"fontFamily: 'var(--mantine-font-family)', \"\n        \"headerFontWeight: 'bold'\"\n        \"})\"\n    )\n}\n\ncomponent = html.Div([\n    dag.AgGrid(\n        id=\"theme-color-scheme33\",\n        rowData=df.to_dict(\"records\"),\n        columnDefs=[{\"field\": i} for i in [\"athlete\", \"country\", \"sport\", \"year\"]],\n        defaultColDef={\"flex\": 1, \"filter\": True},\n        dashGridOptions={\n            \"theme\": theme,\n            \"rowSelection\": {\"mode\": \"multiRow\"}\n        },\n    ),\n    html.Div(id=\"dummy-output\")\n])\n\n\nclientside_callback(\n    \"\"\"\n    (switchOn) => {\n       document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-ag-theme-mode', switchOn ? 'dark' : 'light');  \n       return window.dash_clientside.no_update;        \n    }\n    \"\"\",\n    Output(\"dummy-output\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"docs-color-scheme-switch\", \"checked\"),\n)\n```\n#### Dash AG Grid < v33\n\nBefore dash-ag-grid v33, the grid theme was set using the `className` prop. Four built-in themes were available, each with light and dark variants.\n\nFor example, to apply the Alpine theme:\n\n* Light mode: `className=\"ag-theme-alpine\"` (default)\n* Dark mode: `className=\"ag-theme-alpine-dark\"`\n\nSwitching between light and dark mode required updating the `className` prop in a callback.\n\nFor more details on available themes and customization options, see the [Dash AG Grid styling guide](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-ag-grid/styling-themes) or the [AG Grid v31.3 theme documentation](https://www.ag-grid.com/archive/31.3.0/react-data-grid/themes/).\n\nHere is an example of the callback:\n\n```python\n# Example for dash-ag-grid<=33.0.0\nimport dash_ag_grid as dag\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/ag-grid/space-mission-data.csv\")\n\ncomponent = dag.AgGrid(\n    rowData=df.to_dict(\"records\"),\n    columnDefs=[{\"field\": i} for i in df.columns],\n    id=\"theme-switch-dag31\"\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"theme-switch-dag31\", \"className\"),\n    Input(\"docs-color-scheme-switch\", \"checked\")\n)\ndef update_theme(switch_on):\n    return \"ag-theme-alpine-dark\" if switch_on else \"ag-theme-alpine\"\n```\n\n###  Custom Cell Renderers with DMC\n\nFor an introduction to [dash-ag-grid Cell Renderers](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-ag-grid/cell-renderer-components) refer to the dash documentation.\n\nA cell renderer is a JavaScript function that returns a component to customize the cell content, rather\nthan displaying simple text.  You can use DMC components as custom cell renderers.\n\nKey concepts:\n\n* Define the cell renderer function in a `.js` file in  `/assets/` under `window.dashAgGridComponentFunctions` namespace. Dash registers these components with the grid.\n* Set `cellRenderer` to the function name.\n* Pass extra props to the function with `cellRendererParams`.\n\n\n```js\nvar dagcomponentfuncs = window.dashAgGridComponentFunctions = window.dashAgGridComponentFunctions || {};\n\ndagcomponentfuncs.MyFunction = function (props) {\n   // define your cell renderer here\n}\n```\n\n\n\nWant help writing these custom cell render functions? See [Using AI to Generate Functions](/functions-as-props#using-ai-to-generate-javascript-functions) for how to describe the logic in plain English or Python and convert it to JavaScript.\n\n\n\n#### Example 1:  Card\n\nThis example displays grid data in a DMC `Card` in cells. The card layout is defined in a `.js` file in the `/assets` folder, with\nthe function named `DMC_Card`.\n\n\n```python\n\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_ag_grid as dag\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = {\n    \"stats\": [\"Revenue\", \"EBITDA\", \"Net Income\"],\n    \"results\": ['$13,120,000','$1,117,000', '$788,000'],\n    \"change\": [10.1, -22.1, 18.6],\n    'comments': ['Enter your comments here...', '', '']\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\ncolumnDefs = [\n    {\n        \"headerName\": \"\",\n        \"cellRenderer\": \"DMC_Card\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"field\": \"comments\",\n        \"editable\": True,\n        \"cellEditorPopup\": True,\n        \"cellEditor\": \"agLargeTextCellEditor\",\n        \"flex\": 1\n    },\n]\n\ncomponent = dag.AgGrid(\n    columnDefs=columnDefs,\n    rowData=df.to_dict(\"records\"),\n    dashGridOptions={\"rowHeight\": 120},\n    id=\"dag-dmc-card-grid\",\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"dag-dmc-card-grid\", \"className\"),\n    Input(\"docs-color-scheme-switch\", \"checked\")\n)\ndef update_theme(switch_on):\n    return \"ag-theme-alpine-dark\" if switch_on else \"ag-theme-alpine\"\n```\n\n```javascript\n\nvar dagcomponentfuncs = window.dashAgGridComponentFunctions = window.dashAgGridComponentFunctions || {};\n\ndagcomponentfuncs.DMC_Card = function (props) {\n    return React.createElement(\n        window.dash_mantine_components.Card,\n        {\n            withBorder: true,\n            m: 4,\n        },\n        React.createElement(\n            window.dash_mantine_components.Text,\n            {c:\"dimmed\", tt: \"uppercase\", fw:700},\n            props.data.stats\n        ),\n        React.createElement(\n            window.dash_mantine_components.Text,\n            {size: \"lg\"},\n            props.data.results\n        ),\n        React.createElement(\n            window.dash_mantine_components.Text,\n            {size: \"sm\", c: (props.data.change > 0) ? \"green\" : \"red\"},\n            props.data.change + \"%\"\n        )\n    );\n};\n```\n\n\n\n\n#### Example 2: Buttons\n\nThis example shows how to place interactive buttons inside grid cells. The `DMC_Button` is defined in a `.js` file in\n`/assets` is used in the `cellRenderer` prop. You can pass `Button` props (color, icon, variant, etc.) using \n`cellRendererParams` per column.\n\nHere’s an example for the `\"buy\"` column:\n\n```python\ncolumnDefs = [\n    {\n        \"field\": \"buy\",\n        \"cellRenderer\": \"DMC_Button\",\n        \"cellRendererParams\": {\n            \"variant\": \"outline\",\n            \"leftIcon\": \"ic:baseline-shopping-cart\",\n            \"color\": \"green\",\n            \"radius\": \"xl\"\n        },\n    },\n    #  other columns...\n\n]\n\n\n```\n\n\n```python\n\nimport json\nimport dash_ag_grid as dag\nfrom dash import html, dcc, Input, Output, callback\nimport pandas as pd\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nimport dash_iconify\n\ndata = {\n    \"ticker\": [\"AAPL\", \"MSFT\", \"AMZN\", \"GOOGL\"],\n    \"company\": [\"Apple\", \"Microsoft\", \"Amazon\", \"Alphabet\"],\n    \"price\": [154.99, 268.65, 100.47, 96.75],\n    \"buy\": [\"Buy\" for _ in range(4)],\n    \"sell\": [\"Sell\" for _ in range(4)],\n    \"watch\": [\"Watch\" for _ in range(4)],\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\ncolumnDefs = [\n    {\n        \"headerName\": \"Stock Ticker\",\n        \"field\": \"ticker\",\n        \"minWidth\": 100\n    },\n    {\"headerName\": \"Company\", \"field\": \"company\", \"filter\": True, \"minWidth\": 50},\n    {\n        \"headerName\": \"Last Close Price\",\n        \"type\": \"rightAligned\",\n        \"field\": \"price\",\n        \"valueFormatter\": {\"function\": \"\"\"d3.format(\"($,.2f\")(params.value)\"\"\"},\n        \"minWidth\": 100\n    },\n    {\n        \"field\": \"buy\",\n        \"cellRenderer\": \"DMC_Button\",\n        \"cellRendererParams\": {\n            \"variant\": \"outline\",\n            \"leftIcon\": \"ic:baseline-shopping-cart\",\n            \"color\": \"green\",\n            \"radius\": \"xl\"\n        },\n        \"minWidth\": 100\n    },\n    {\n        \"field\": \"sell\",\n        \"cellRenderer\": \"DMC_Button\",\n        \"cellRendererParams\": {\n            \"variant\": \"outline\",\n            \"leftIcon\": \"ic:baseline-shopping-cart\",\n            \"color\": \"red\",\n            \"radius\": \"xl\"\n        },\n        \"minWidth\": 100\n    },\n    {\n        \"field\": \"watch\",\n        \"cellRenderer\": \"DMC_Button\",\n        \"cellRendererParams\": {\n            \"rightIcon\": \"ph:eye\",\n        },\n        \"minWidth\": 100\n    },\n]\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dag.AgGrid(\n            id=\"dag-dmc-btn-grid\",\n            columnDefs=columnDefs,\n            rowData=df.to_dict(\"records\"),\n            columnSize=\"autoSize\",\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"dag-dmc-btn-value-changed\"),\n    ],\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"dag-dmc-btn-value-changed\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"dag-dmc-btn-grid\", \"cellRendererData\"),\n)\ndef showChange(n):\n    return json.dumps(n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"dag-dmc-btn-grid\", \"className\"),\n    Input(\"docs-color-scheme-switch\", \"checked\")\n)\ndef update_theme(switch_on):\n    return \"ag-theme-alpine-dark\" if switch_on else \"ag-theme-alpine\"\n```\n\n```javascript\n\nvar dagcomponentfuncs = window.dashAgGridComponentFunctions = window.dashAgGridComponentFunctions || {};\n\ndagcomponentfuncs.DMC_Button = function (props) {\n    const {setData, data} = props;\n\n    function onClick() {\n        setData();\n    }\n    let leftIcon, rightIcon;\n    if (props.leftIcon) {\n        leftIcon = React.createElement(window.dash_iconify.DashIconify, {\n            icon: props.leftIcon,\n        });\n    }\n    if (props.rightIcon) {\n        rightIcon = React.createElement(window.dash_iconify.DashIconify, {\n            icon: props.rightIcon,\n        });\n    }\n    return React.createElement(\n        window.dash_mantine_components.Button,\n        {\n            onClick,\n            variant: props.variant,\n            color: props.color,\n            leftSection: leftIcon,\n            rightSection: rightIcon,\n            radius: props.radius,\n            style: {\n                margin: props.margin,\n                display: 'flex',\n                justifyContent: 'center',\n                alignItems: 'center',\n            },\n        },\n        props.value\n    );\n};\n```\n\n\n\n###  Custom Cell editors with DMC\n\nDash AG Grid includes several [built-in cell editors](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-ag-grid/provided-cell-editors), such as:\n- Text Cell Editor\n- Large Text Cell Editor\n- Select Cell Editor\n- Rich Select Cell Editor (AG Grid Enterprise)\n- Number Cell Editor\n- Date Cell Editor\n- Checkbox Cell Editor\n\nThese editors are easy to use and require no extra JavaScript. But if you need more control or want to use DMC components\nas cell editors, you can create a custom cell editor.\n\nThe example below uses a generic editor function that works with any DMC component. Just copy the `.js` file into your app’s `/assets` folder to use it.\n(Thanks to Dash community member [@BSd3v](https://github.com/BSd3v) for creating this!)\n\nThen in your dash app you can pass a component written in Python to the function using the `cellEditorParams` prop:\n\n```python\ncolumnDefs = [\n    {\n        'cellEditor': {'function': 'AllFunctionalComponentEditors'},\n        \"cellEditorParams\": {\n            \"component\": dmc.Select(data=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"])\n        }\n    },\n    \n]\n```\n\n\n#### Example: DatePickerInput, TagsInput, Select \n\nThis example shows how to use the following DMC components as custom cell editors:\n\n* `dmc.DatePickerInput`\n* `dmc.TagsInput`\n* `dmc.Select`\n\nNote: Set `cellEditorPopup=True` for any editor that displays dropdowns, popovers, or calendars. This prevents clipping inside the grid.\n\n\n\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nimport dash_ag_grid as dag\nimport pandas as pd\n\nnow = \"2025-12-30\"\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Column 1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],\n    'DatePickerInput': [now, now, now, now, now, now],\n    'TagsInput': [['A']] * 6,  # Note TagsInput values must be a list\n    'Select': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C']\n})\n\ncolumnDefs = [\n    { \"field\": \"Column 1\", \"headerName\": \"id\", \"maxWidth\": 50},\n    {\n        \"field\": \"DatePickerInput\",\n        'cellEditor': {'function': 'AllFunctionalComponentEditors'},\n        'cellEditorParams': {'component': dmc.DatePickerInput(valueFormat=\"YYYY-MM-DD\")},\n        'cellEditorPopup': True,\n    },\n    {\n        \"field\": \"TagsInput\",\n        'cellEditor': {'function': 'AllFunctionalComponentEditors'},\n        'cellEditorParams': {'component': dmc.TagsInput(data=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"])},\n        'cellEditorPopup': True,\n        \"flex\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"field\": \"Select\",\n        'cellEditor': {'function': 'AllFunctionalComponentEditors'},\n        'cellEditorParams': {'component': dmc.Select(data=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"])},\n        'cellEditorPopup': True,\n        \"flex\": 1\n    },\n]\n\n\ncomponent = dag.AgGrid(\n    id='dag-dmc-cell-editor',\n    columnDefs=columnDefs,\n    rowData=df.to_dict('records'),\n    defaultColDef={'editable': True, \"minWidth\": 150},\n    dashGridOptions={'singleClickEdit': True}\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"dag-dmc-cell-editor\", \"className\"),\n    Input(\"docs-color-scheme-switch\", \"checked\")\n)\ndef update_theme(switch_on):\n    return \"ag-theme-alpine-dark\" if switch_on else \"ag-theme-alpine\"\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dagfuncs = (window.dashAgGridFunctions = window.dashAgGridFunctions || {});\n\nconst {useRef, createElement, useEffect, useCallback, forwardRef, useMemo} = React\n\n// Use this with DMC components\ndagfuncs.AllFunctionalComponentEditors = forwardRef(({ value, ...params }, ref) => {\n    const comp = params.colDef.cellEditorParams.component;\n    const node = useRef(params.api.getRowNode(params.node.id));\n    const newValue = useRef(value);\n    const escaped = useRef(null);\n    const editorRef = useRef(null);\n\n    const handleStop = ({ event, ...params }) => {\n        setTimeout(() => {\n            if (!escaped.current) {\n                node.current.setDataValue(params.column.colId, newValue.current);\n            }\n        }, 1);\n    };\n\n    if (params.colDef.cellEditorPopup) {\n        comp['props']['style'] = { ...comp.props?.style, width: params.column.actualWidth - 2 };\n    }\n\n    const setProps = (propsToSet) => {\n        if ('value' in propsToSet) {\n            newValue.current = propsToSet.value;\n        }\n    };\n\n    const handleKeyDown = ({ key, ...event }) => {\n        if (key == \"Escape\") {\n            escaped.current = true;\n        }\n    };\n\n    useEffect(() => {\n        params.api.addEventListener('cellEditingStopped', handleStop);\n        document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);\n        params.colDef.suppressKeyboardEvent = (params) => params.editing && params.event.key != 'Tab';\n        return () => {\n            document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);\n            delete params.colDef.suppressKeyboardEvent;\n            params.api.removeEventListener('cellEditingStopped', handleStop);\n        };\n    }, []);\n\n    useEffect(() => {\n        if (editorRef.current) {\n            if (editorRef.current.querySelector('input')) {\n                editorRef.current.querySelector('input').focus();\n            } else {\n                editorRef.current.focus()\n            }\n        }\n    }, [editorRef.current]);\n\n    const el = useMemo(() =>\n        createElement(\n            'div',\n            { ref: editorRef, tabIndex: 0 },\n            createElement(window[comp['namespace']][comp['type']], { ...comp.props, setProps, value })\n        ),\n    []);\n\n    return el;\n});\n```"

Includes integration with dcc.Loading and examples of custom CSS-based spinners.  \nCategory: Dash  \n\n### DMC Loading components\n\nDMC has several components that are often used to indicate a component's loading state:\n\n- [Loader](/components/loader): A basic visual spinner (oval, bars, or dots) for simple loading states. Can be customized with size, color, and type.\n\n- [LoadingOverlay](/components/loadingoverlay): Overlays a parent element with a loader, disabling user interaction to indicate a loading state, commonly used for forms.\n- [Progress](/components/progress): A progress bar that shows task status and completion percentage. Customizable with value, color, label, and sections.\n- [Button](/components/button) and [ActionIcon](/components/actionicon) (`loading` prop): Integrates a `Loader` into buttons and icons.  Disables Button while `loading=True`.\n- [Skeleton](/components/skeleton): Creates placeholders resembling content layout to give users a preview while loading, reducing perceived wait time.\n\n\n### With dcc.Loading\n\nFor greater control over when the DMC loading components are displayed and for how long, use the `dcc.Loading` component from\n`dash-core-components`. DMC components such as `Skeleton`, `Loader`, `LoadingOverlay` can be displayed in the `custom_spinner` prop.\n\nYou can configure options such as:  \n\n- `delay_show`: Specifies the wait time before displaying the loading component. This helps prevent flickering for fast-loading content.  \n- `delay_hide`: Defines how long the loading component remains visible after loading completes, creating a smoother transition between the placeholder and final content.  \n- `target_components`: Determines which components trigger the loader to display. This makes the loading effect triggered only by specific components rather than  being triggered by any of the children.\n\nRefer to the [Dash Documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components/loading) for more details.\n\nHere is an example of `delay_hide` prop in `dcc.Loading` to prevent the `Skeleton` from showing for a very short time.\n\n```python\nimport time\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import  Input, Output,  html, callback, dcc\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dcc.Loading(\n            children=html.Div([\n                dmc.Text(\"Initial data\", id=\"dccloading-div\"),\n                dmc.Text(\"The data only takes 200ms to update, but `delay_hide` is set to 1000ms to prevent flashing.\")\n            ]),\n            delay_hide=1000,\n            custom_spinner = dmc.Skeleton(\n                visible=True,\n                h=\"100%\"\n            ),\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\"Update!\", id=\"dccloading-button\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"dccloading-div\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"dccloading-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True\n)\ndef update_graph(n):\n    time.sleep(.2)\n    return f\"Data updated {n} times\"\n```\n### Custom CSS Loaders Using data-dash-is-loading\n\n\nDash automatically adds the attribute `data-dash-is-loading=\"true\"` to components that are being updated in a callback.\nYou can use this attribute to apply custom loading indicators using CSS — no extra Python code or spinner components needed!\n\n\n#### Basic Example\n\nYou can hide a component’s content and display a custom loader using just CSS:\n\n```css\n/* Hide the content while it's loading */\n[data-dash-is-loading=\"true\"] {\n    visibility: hidden;\n    position: relative;\n}\n\n/* Show a loader */\n[data-dash-is-loading=\"true\"]::before {\n    content: \"Loading...\";\n    visibility: visible;\n    position: absolute;\n    left: 50%;\n    top: 50%;\n    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);\n}\n```\n\n\nIn your Dash layout:\n\n```python\ndmc.Text(id=\"output-id\", className=\"my-output\")\n```\n\nIn your `assets/style.css`:\n\n```css\n.my-output[data-dash-is-loading=\"true\"]::before {\n    /* Custom loader styles */\n}\n```\n\nNow, whenever `output-id` is being updated by a callback, your custom loader will appear in place of the original content.\n\n### Example with 3 custom spinners\n\nThis example has 3 custom spinner defined in the `.css` file in `/assets`.  The different loaders are applied to the\ncomponent based on the `className`.\n\n\n\n```python\nfrom dash import  Input, Output, callback\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nimport time\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.Title(\" Dash Spinner Loader Showcase\", order=2),\n\n    dmc.Card([\n        dmc.Select(\n            label=\"Pulse Loader\",\n            placeholder=\"Choose an option...\",\n            data=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"],\n            id=\"dash-is-loading-input-1\"\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"dash-is-loading-output-1\", className=\"output-example-loading\",  py=\"lg\")\n    ],\n        className=\"pulse-loader\",\n        withBorder=True\n    ),\n\n    dmc.Card([\n        dmc.Select(\n            label=\"Ring Loader\",\n            placeholder=\"Choose an option...\",\n            data=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"],\n            id=\"dash-is-loading-input-2\"\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"dash-is-loading-output-2\", className=\"output-example-loading\", py=\"lg\")\n    ], className=\"ring-loader\", withBorder=True),\n\n    dmc.Card([\n        dmc.Select(\n            label=\"Bounce Loader\",\n            placeholder=\"Choose an option...\",\n            data=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"],\n            id=\"dash-is-loading-input-3\"\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"dash-is-loading-output-3\", className=\"output-example-loading\",  py=\"xl\")\n    ], className=\"bounce-loader\"),\n\n\n])\n\n@callback(Output(\"dash-is-loading-output-1\", \"children\"), Input(\"dash-is-loading-input-1\", \"value\"))\ndef update_output1(value):\n    time.sleep(2)\n    return f\"You selected: {value}\"\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"dash-is-loading-output-2\", \"children\"), Input(\"dash-is-loading-input-2\", \"value\"))\ndef update_output2(value):\n    time.sleep(2)\n    return f\"You selected: {value}\"\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"dash-is-loading-output-3\", \"children\"), Input(\"dash-is-loading-input-3\", \"value\"))\ndef update_output3(value):\n    time.sleep(2)\n    return f\"You selected: {value}\"\n```\n\n```css\n\n/* Output Base Hidden + Loader Target */\n*[data-dash-is-loading=\"true\"] {\n    visibility: hidden;\n    position: relative;\n}\n*[data-dash-is-loading=\"true\"]::before {\n    visibility: visible;\n    position: absolute;\n    left: 50%;\n    top: 50%;\n    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);  /* centers the spinner */\n    content: \"\";\n}\n\n/* pulse loader */\n.pulse-loader .output-example-loading[data-dash-is-loading=\"true\"]::before {\n    content: \"\";\n    width: 20px;\n    height: 20px;\n    border-radius: 50%;\n    background-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-filled);\n    position: absolute;\n    left: 50%;\n    top: 50%;\n    transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0.95);\n    animation: pulseAnim 1s infinite ease-in-out;\n    visibility: visible;\n}\n\n@keyframes pulseAnim {\n    0% { transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0.95); opacity: 1; }\n    50% { transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(1.2); opacity: 0.6; }\n    100% { transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0.95); opacity: 1; }\n}\n\n/* Loader: Ring */\n.ring-loader .output-example-loading[data-dash-is-loading=\"true\"]::before {\n    content: \"\";\n    width: 40px;\n    height: 40px;\n    border: 4px solid #f3f3f3;\n    border-top: 4px solid var(--mantine-color-green-filled);\n    border-radius: 50%;\n    position: absolute;\n    left: 50%;\n    top: 50%;\n    transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotate(0deg);\n    animation: ringSpin 1s linear infinite;\n    visibility: visible;\n}\n\n@keyframes ringSpin {\n    0% { transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotate(0deg); }\n    100% { transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotate(360deg); }\n}\n\n\n\n/* Loader: Bounce Dots */\n.bounce-loader .output-example-loading[data-dash-is-loading=\"true\"]::before {\n    content: \"\";\n    display: inline-block;\n    width: 60px;\n    height: 16px;\n    position: absolute;\n    left: 50%;\n    top: 50%;\n    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);\n}\n\n.bounce-loader .output-example-loading[data-dash-is-loading=\"true\"]::before {\n    background: transparent;\n}\n\n.bounce-loader .output-example-loading[data-dash-is-loading=\"true\"]::before {\n    content: \"● ● ●\";\n    color: var(--mantine-color-orange-filled);\n    font-size: 22px;\n    letter-spacing: 6px;\n    animation: dotBounce 1.2s infinite ease-in-out;\n}\n\n/* Animation for Dots */\n@keyframes dotBounce {\n    0%, 80%, 100% {\n        opacity: 0.2;\n        transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0.8);\n    }\n    40% {\n        opacity: 1;\n        transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(1.2);\n    }\n}\n```"

    "content": "\n\n## Functions as Props  \nIntroduction to using JavaScript functions with Dash Mantine Components  \nCategory: Dash  \n\n### How Function Props Work\n\nIn JavaScript libraries like [Mantine](https://mantine.dev), some component props accept functions — for example, to\ndynamically format a value, render custom content, or control behavior. Here is an example of formating the label of the `Slider`\n\n**In Mantine**\n```js\n<Slider label={(value) => `${value} °C`}  />\n```\n\nHowever, in a Dash app, you can’t pass a function to the component because functions don't serialize over the network.\n\nTo support this safely, Dash Mantine Components allows you to pass named references to JavaScript functions instead.\n\nYou write your function in a `.js` file in the `/assets` folder, and refer to it by name in Python:\n\n**app.py**\n```python\ndmc.Slider(label={\"function\": \"celsiusLabel\"}, value=40)\n```\n\n**assets/formatCelsius.js**\n```js\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.celsiusLabel = function(value) {\n  return `${value} °C`;\n};\n```\n\nDMC knows how to call this function in the browser for props like `label`.\n\n\n### Example: Formatting a Slider label\n\nSee more examples in the [Slider section](/components/slider) section.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Slider(label={\"function\": \"celsiusLabel\"}, value=40, labelAlwaysOn=True)\n```\n\n```javascript\n\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.celsiusLabel = (value) => `${value} °C`;\n```\n\n\n\n### Function Props in Mantine Components\n\nNot all Mantine props accept functions — only specific ones are designed to.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n* `Slider`: `label`\n* `Select`: `renderOption`\n* `BarChart`: `getBarColor`\n* `ScatterChart`: `valueFormat`\n\nFor a full list of supported function props in Dash Mantine Components, see the table at the bottom of this page.\n\nEach function must match the structure expected by Mantine. To learn what arguments each one receives — and how they’re\nused — refer to the [Mantine documentation](https://mantine.dev). You’ll also find complete working examples in the relevant sections of the DMC docs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Passing Extra Options\n\nYou can pass extra options from Python to customize how the JavaScript function behaves.\n\nIn this example, the same function can be used to format the label using either Celsius or Fahrenheit.\n\n.py\n```python\ndmc.Slider(\n    label={\n        \"function\": \"formatTemperature\",\n        \"options\": {\"unit\": \"F\"}\n    },\n    # other props\n)\n```\n\n.js\n```js\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.formatTemperature = function (value, { unit }) {\n  if (unit === \"F\") {\n    return `${(value * 9 / 5 + 32).toFixed(1)} °F`;\n  }\n  return `${value.toFixed(1)} °C`;\n};\n```\n\n###  Returning a Component\n\nIts also possible to return React components.  To do this:\n\n- Use `React.createElement()` (no JSX).\n- access DMC components by using  `window.dash_mantine_components`.\n- If you've imported other component libraries in your Dash app, you can use them too. For example  `window.dash_iconify`, `window.dash_core_components`, etc.\n\nSee examples of including icons in the dropdown data in the `Select` section of the docs.\n\n### Example: Components and passing extra options\n\nThis example shows\n  - Returning a component.  Note the dropdown data is formated as a `Badge`.\n  - Passing extra options to the JavaScript function.  The colors for each badge are passed to the function from the dash app.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncolors = {\n    \"Pandas\": \"grape\",\n    \"NumPy\": \"blue\",\n    \"Matplotlib\": \"teal\",\n    \"Plotly\": \"violet\",\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    label=\"Choose a library\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick one\",\n    data=list(colors.keys()),\n    renderOption={\n        \"function\": \"renderBadge\",\n        \"options\": {\"colors\": colors},\n    },\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\nvar dmc = window.dash_mantine_components;\n\ndmcfuncs.renderBadge = function ({option}, {colors}) {\n  return React.createElement(\n    dmc.Badge,\n    {\n      color: colors[option.value] || \"gray\",\n      variant: \"light\",\n      radius: \"sm\",\n    },\n    option.value\n  );\n};\n```\n\n\n\n\n### Using Other JavaScript Libraries\nYou can use third-party JavaScript libraries inside your Dash functions — as long as you include them correctly in your app.\n\nHere is an example of including the `dayjs` library as an external script:\n\n```python\napp = Dash(exteral_scripts=[\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dayjs/1.10.8/dayjs.min.js\"])\n```\n\n.js\n```json\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.excludeDate = function(dateStr) {\n   const date = dayjs(dateStr, \"YYYY-MM-DD\");\n   return date.isValid() && date.day() !== 5;\n}\n```\n\n### Use AI to Help Write JavaScript\n\nMost Dash users are more comfortable writing Python than JavaScript. You can use AI tools like ChatGPT to generate the\nJavaScript functions needed for Dash Mantine Components.\n\nWhile it's possible to describe the logic in plain English, in practice, writing the function in Python and asking the \nAI to translate it tends to produce more accurate and usable results. It gives the model a clear structure and avoids\nambiguity, especially for functions with conditions, formatting rules, or custom output.\n\n#### Prompt Template\nWhen asking AI to generate a function:\n\n1. State the function name.\n2. Mention it’s for Dash Mantine Components.\n3. Ask it to assign the function to dmcfuncs.functionName.\n4. Provide the Python logic (or natural language)\n5. Always include this global header:\n    ```\n    var dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n    ```\n6. If the function returns a component, mention:\n   - Use `React.createElement`\n   - Don’t use JSX\n   - Use `window.dash_mantine_components`\n\n\n#### Example 1:  Simple function\n\nAI Prompt:\n\n> Write a JavaScript function for Dash Mantine Components named `formatUsd`. Assign it to `dmcfuncs.formatUsd`. In Python, the function would be:\n>\n> ```python\n> def formatUsd(value):\n     return f\"${value:,.2f}\"\n> ```\n\nAI Output:\n\n```js\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.formatUsd = function (value) {\n  return `$${new Intl.NumberFormat(\"en-US\", { minimumFractionDigits: 2 }).format(value)}`;\n};\n```\n\n\n\n#### Example 2 Function with options\n\nAI Prompt:\n\n> Write a JavaScript function for Dash Mantine Components named `formatTemp`. Assign it to `dmcfuncs.formatTemp`. In Python, the function would be:\n> ```python\n> def formatTemp(value, unit=\"C\"):\n>    if unit == \"F\":\n>        return f\"{value * 9 / 5 + 32:.1f} °F\"\n>    return f\"{value:.1f} °C\"\n>```\n\nAI Output:\n\n```js\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.formatTemp = function (value, { unit }) {\n  if (unit === \"F\") {\n    return `${(value * 9 / 5 + 32).toFixed(1)} °F`;\n  }\n  return `${value.toFixed(1)} °C`;\n};\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Example 3: Return a Component\n\n\nAI Prompt\n\n> Write a JavaScript function for Dash Mantine Components named `renderBadge`. Assign it to `dmcfuncs.renderBadge`. \n> This function returns a React component. Use `React.createElement`. Do not use JSX. Use `dmc = window.dash_mantine_components`.\n> In Python, the function would be:\n\n> ```python\n> def renderBadge(option):\n>    return dmc.Badge(\n>        option[\"value\"],\n>        color= \"red\" if option[\"value\"] == \"A\" else \"blue\",\n>        variant=\"light\",\n>        radius=\"sm\"        \n>    )\n> ```\n\n\nAI Output\n\n```js\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\nvar dmc = window.dash_mantine_components;\n\ndmcfuncs.renderBadge = function ({ option }) {\n  return React.createElement(\n    dmc.Badge,\n    {\n      color: option.value === \"A\" ? \"red\" : \"blue\",\n      variant: \"light\",\n      radius: \"sm\"\n    },\n    option.value\n  );\n};\n\n```\n\nSupported props in V2\n\nThe following props support JavaScript functions in Dash Mantine Components version >=2.0.0.\nIf there’s a Mantine prop you’d like to see added, feel free to [open an issue on GitHub.](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/issues)\n\n| Component        | Props                                     |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Slider           | label, scale                              |\n| RangeSlider      | label, scale                              |\n| Select           | renderOption, filter                      |\n| MultiSelect      | renderOption, filter                      |\n| TagsInput        | renderOption, filter                      |\n| DatePickerInput  | disabledDates                             |\n| DateInput        | disabledDates                             |\n| DateTimePicker   | disabledDates                             |\n| MonthPickerInput | disabledDates                             |\n| YearPickerInput  | disabledDates                             |\n| BarChart         | getBarColor, valueFormatter, tooltipProps |\n| AreaChart        | valueFormatter, tooltipProps              |\n| LineChart        | valueFormatter, tooltipProps              |\n| CompositeChart   | valueFormatter, tooltipProps              |\n| BubbleChart      | valueFormatter, tooltipProps              |\n| ScatterChart     | valueFormatter, tooltipProps              |\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Supported props in V2.1.0\n\n\n| Component        | Props                                                             |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| AutoComplete     | renderOption, filter                                              |\n| DatePickerInput  | getYearControlProps, getMonthControlProps, getDayProps, renderDay |\n| DateInput        | getYearControlProps, getMonthControlProps, getDayProps, renderDay |\n| DateTimePicker   | getYearControlProps, getMonthControlProps, getDayProps, renderDay |\n| MonthPickerInput | getYearControlProps, getMonthControlProps                         |\n| YearPickerInput  | getYearControlProps                                               |\n| Tree             | renderNode                                                        |\n\n\nAdditional Supported props in V2.4.0\n\n| Component                                                                 | Props                                              |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |\n| AreaChart, BarChart, BubbleChart, CompositeChart, LineChart, ScatterChart | xAxisProps, yAxisProps, gridProps, rightYAxisProps |\n| BubbleChart                                                               | zAxisProps                                         |"

Reduce callback load and improve performance in text inputs, dropdowns, pickers, and more.  \nCategory: Dash  \n\n### About the debounce prop\n\n\nThe `debounce` prop delays the update of a component's value until the user stops interacting, reducing callback\nfrequency for inputs.\n\n\nTo control how often the input's value is updated while the user is typing, use the `debounce` prop:\n\n- `debounce=False` Is the default and it will update as the user interacts with the input.\n- Set `debounce=True` to update the value only when the user finishes typing and moves focus away (i.e. on blur).\n- Set `debounce=<milliseconds>` to update the value after a specified delay from the user's last keystroke. For example,\n`debounce=300` will wait 300 milliseconds after the user stops typing before updating the value.\n\n\n####  debounce=False\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    gap=50,\n    children=[\n        dmc.TimePicker(label=\"Enter a time\", id=\"timepicker-usage\"),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"out-timepicker\")\n    ],\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"out-timepicker\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"timepicker-usage\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update(value):\n    return f\"You entered: {value}\"\n```\n####  debounce=True\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    gap=50,\n    children=[\n        dmc.TimePicker(\n            label=\"Enter a time\",\n            debounce=True,\n            id=\"timepicker-debounce\"\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"out-timepicker-debounce\")\n    ],\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"out-timepicker-debounce\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"timepicker-debounce\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update(value):\n    return f\"You entered: {value}\"\n```\n#### debounce=1000\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    gap=50,\n    children=[\n        dmc.TimePicker(\n            label=\"Enter a time\",\n            debounce=1000,\n            id=\"timepicker-debounce-ms\"\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"out-timepicker-debounce-ms\")\n    ],\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"out-timepicker-debounce-ms\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"timepicker-debounce-ms\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update(value):\n    return f\"You entered: {value}\"\n```\n### Example with TextInput\n\nThis example uses `debounce=True`.  Note that the comments are updated only after the user has\nfinished entering data.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import  callback, Input, Output\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n\n    [\n        dmc.TextInput(\n            id=\"debounce-text\",\n            label=\"Enter your comments\",\n            debounce=True\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"debounce-text-output\"),\n    ],\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"debounce-text-output\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"debounce-text\", \"value\"),\n)\ndef update_output(comments):\n    if not comments:\n        return \"\"\n    return f\"Thank you for your feedback: {comments}\"\n```\n### Supported Components\nThe `debounce` prop is supported by many DMC input components, including:\n\n- TextInput\n\n- Textarea\n\n- NumberInput\n\n- PasswordInput\n\n- JsonInput\n\n- Select, MultiSelect, Autocomplete\n\n- DateInput, DateTimePicker, DatePickerInput\n\n- MonthPickerInput, YearPickerInput, TimeInput, TimePicker\n\n- RichTextEditor\n\n\nFor the `Slider` and `RangeSlider`  use [updatemode](/components/slider#update-mode)\n\n### Usage Tips\n\n- Use `debounce=True` for forms where you only care about the final value after the user finishes typing, for example, email fields, names, comments.\n\n- Use `debounce=300` or higher for search boxes or filters that trigger live updates (for example,  querying a table or filtering a plot). This prevents the app from firing a callback on every keystroke and keeps things responsive.\n\n- Combine with `n_submit` or `n_blur` if you want finer control over when inputs send updates."

    "content": "\n\n## persistence props  \nDash Mantine Components support Dash’s built-in persistence system, allowing component values to be retained across page reloads, tabs, or user sessions — without writing extra callbacks.  \nCategory: Dash  \n\n### Overview: Persistence in Dash\n\nWhen a user interacts with a component (like typing in a `TextInput` or selecting a `Date`), its value is\nstored in local memory (or optionally, in localStorage or sessionStorage). If the user refreshes the page, navigates\naway and returns, or reopens the tab, that value can be restored automatically.\n\nThis helps maintain app state with minimal effort.\n\n### How to Enable Persistence\n\nYou can enable persistence on any supported component by setting these props:\n\n```python\npersistence=True\npersisted_props=[\"value\"]  # or other prop(s) to persist. Typically use the default.\npersistence_type=\"local\"   # \"local\", \"session\", or \"memory\" (default is \"local\")\nid=\"component-id\"  # required for persistence to work\n```\n\n### Example: Persistent TextInput\nTry typing something in each box, then refresh the browser to see which one remembers your input.\n    \n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.TextInput(\n            id=\"persisted-input\", # id required-  persistence only works on components with an id\n            label=\"With persistence\",\n            placeholder=\"This will stick\",\n            persistence=True,\n        ),\n        dmc.TextInput(\n            id=\"non-persisted-input\",\n            label=\"Without persistence\",\n            placeholder=\"This will reset\",\n        ),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Important Notes\n\n* In DMC, the `persisted_prop` is already set with an appropriate default for each component, so you don’t need to specify it.\n* An `id` is required — persistence will not work without one.\n* Due to [an open issue in Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/3147), persistence does not work if your layout is simply a list of components. The layout must be a single component (or a function returning one).\n\nThis **does work**:\n\n```python\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    dmc.Container([\n        dmc.Select(id=\"select\", data=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"], persistence=True)\n    ])\n)\n```\n\nThis **will not work**:\n\n```python\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    [\n        dmc.Select(id=\"select\", data=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"], persistence=True)\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n### Supported DMC Components\n\nPersistence is available for all stateful inputs in DMC — including:\n\n* `TextInput`, `Textarea`, `PasswordInput`, `NumberInput`\n* `Select`, `MultiSelect`, `TagsInput`\n* `Checkbox`, `RadioGroup`, `Switch`\n* `DateInput`, `DateTimePicker`, `TimeInput`, etc.\n\nTo check if a specific component supports persistence, look for the `persistence`, `persisted_props`, and\n`persistence_type` props in the Keyword Arguments section of its documentation.\n\n\n\n### Reference\n\nFor more details see the [Persistence section in the Dash documentation.](https://dash.plotly.com/persistence)\n\n- `persistence` (boolean | string | number; optional): Any truthy value will enable persistence for this component. Persistence is keyed to the combination of component id and this persistence value, so if this value changes you will see different persisted settings. For example, perhaps you have dropdowns for country and city, and you know that your users want to see the same country pre-filled as the last time they used your app - you can just set persistence=True on the country dropdown. But for the city they would like to see the same one as the last time they chose that country - just set persistence=country_name (where country_name is the value of the chosen country) on the city dropdown and we'll save one preferred city for each country.\n\n- `persistence_type` ('local', 'session', or 'memory'; default 'local'): Where persisted user changes will be stored:\n\n  - `memory`: only kept in memory, reset on page refresh. This is useful for example if you have a tabbed app, that deletes the component when a different tab is active, and you want changes persisted as you switch tabs but not after reloading the app.\n  - `local`: uses window.localStorage. This is the default, and keeps the data indefinitely within that browser on that computer.\n  - `session`: uses window.sessionStorage. Like 'local' the data is kept when you reload the page, but cleared when you close the browser or open the app in a new browser tab.\n\n- `persistence_props` (list of strings; optional): These are the props whose values will persist. Typically this defaults to all user-editable props, which in many cases is just one (ie 'value'). dash-table has many props users can edit, and all of them except 'data' are included here by default. Sometimes only a part of a prop is saved; this happens with table headers, which are only part of the columns prop. The corresponding persistence_props value is 'columns.name'."

`ActionIcon` or `Menu`.\n This enables interaction with the element without affecting the opening or closing of the accordion item.

    "content": "\n\n## Avatar  \nUse Avatar to display user profile pictures. It supports images, icons, or letters. Use AvatarGroup to display stack Avatar components.  \nCategory: Data Display  \n\n### Simple Usage\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    children=[\n        dmc.Avatar(\n            src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91216500?v=4\", radius=\"xl\"\n        ),\n        # default placeholder\n        dmc.Avatar(radius=\"xl\"),\n        # initials\n        dmc.Avatar(\"MK\", color=\"cyan\", radius=\"xl\"),\n        # icon\n        dmc.Avatar(DashIconify(icon=\"radix-icons:star\"), color=\"blue\", radius=\"xl\"),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Initials\nTo display initials instead of the default placeholder, set name prop to the name of the person, for example,\n`name='John Doe'`. If the name is set, you can use `color='initials'` to generate color based on the name:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\n\nnames = [\n    \"John Doe\",\n    \"Jane Mol\",\n    \"Alex Lump\",\n    \"Sarah Condor\",\n    \"Mike Johnson\",\n    \"Kate Kok\",\n    \"Tom Smith\",\n]\n\navatars = [dmc.Avatar(name=name, color=\"initials\") for name in names]\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(avatars)\n```\n### Allowed initials colors\nBy default, all colors from the default theme are allowed for initials, you can restrict them by providing \n`allowedInitialsColors` prop with an array of colors. Note that the default colors array does not include custom\ncolors defined in the theme, you need to provide them manually if needed.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nnames = [\n    \"John Doe\",\n    \"Jane Mol\",\n    \"Alex Lump\",\n    \"Sarah Condor\",\n    \"Mike Johnson\",\n    \"Kate Kok\",\n    \"Tom Smith\",\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.Avatar(name=n, color=\"initials\", allowedInitialsColors=[\"blue\", \"red\"])\n        for n in names\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Size, Radius and Variant\n\nControl Avatar's height and width with `size` prop and border-radius with `radius` prop. Both props have\npredefined values: xs, sm, md, lg, xl. Alternatively, a number can be used to set radius or size in px.\n\nYou can also use `variant` to style the Avatar.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Avatar(src=\"/assets/avatar.jpeg\", size=\"sm\"),\ndmc.Avatar(src=\"/assets/avatar.jpeg\"),\ndmc.Avatar(src=\"/assets/avatar.jpeg\", size=50, radius=\"xl\"),\ndmc.Avatar(src=\"/assets/avatar.jpeg\", size=\"xl\", radius=20),\ndmc.Avatar(src=\"/assets/avatar.jpeg\", size=\"xl\", variant=\"outline\"),\n```\n\n### Avatar Group\n\nUse AvatarGroup to stack Avatar components.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.AvatarGroup(\n    children=[\n        dmc.Avatar(\n            src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91216500?v=4\", radius=\"xl\"\n        ),\n        dmc.Avatar(\n            src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24227892?v=4\", radius=\"xl\"\n        ),\n        dmc.Avatar(radius=\"xl\"),\n        dmc.Avatar(\"MK\", color=\"cyan\", radius=\"xl\"),\n        dmc.Avatar(DashIconify(icon=\"radix-icons:star\"), color=\"blue\", radius=\"xl\"),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Avatar link with tooltip\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\ncomponent = html.A(\n    dmc.Tooltip(\n        dmc.Avatar(\n            src=\"https://e7.pngegg.com/pngimages/799/987/png-clipart-computer-icons-avatar-icon-design-avatar-heroes\"\n            \"-computer-wallpaper-thumbnail.png\",\n            size=\"lg\",\n            radius=\"xl\",\n        ),\n        label=\"Snehil Vijay\",\n        position=\"bottom\",\n    ),\n    href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/snehilvj/\",\n    target=\"_blank\",\n)\n```\n### Dynamically created AvatarGroup\n\nHere's an example of a dynamically created AvatarGroup from GitHub contributors to DMC library.\n\n```python\nfrom os import environ\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nimport requests\n\n\ndef create_contributors_list():\n    resp = requests.get(\n        \"https://api.github.com/repos/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/contributors\",\n        headers={\"authorization\": f\"token {environ['CONTRIB_TOKEN']}\"},\n    )\n    contributors = resp.json()\n\n    children = []\n    for user in contributors:\n        avatar = dmc.Avatar(src=user[\"avatar_url\"], radius=\"xl\")\n        children.append(avatar)\n\n    return dmc.AvatarGroup(children, id=\"avatar-group\")\n\n\ncomponent = create_contributors_list() if \"CONTRIB_TOKEN\" in environ else None\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

Refer to [Embla Carousel Auto Scroll Options](https://www.embla-carousel.com/plugins/auto-scroll/#options) to learn more.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Carousel(\n    [\n        dmc.CarouselSlide(dmc.Center(\"Slide-1\", bg=\"blue\", c=\"white\", p=60)),\n        dmc.CarouselSlide(dmc.Center(\"Slide-2\", bg=\"blue\", c=\"white\", p=60)),\n        dmc.CarouselSlide(dmc.Center(\"Slide-3\", bg=\"blue\", c=\"white\", p=60)),\n    ],\n    id=\"carousel-autoscroll\",\n    emblaOptions={\"loop\": True},\n    autoScroll=True,\n)\n```\n### Autoplay\nEnable autoplay by setting `autoplay=True` or by passing in a `dict` with options. Refer to [Embla Carousel Autoplay Options](https://www.embla-carousel.com/plugins/autoplay/#options) to learn more.\n\n```python\nimport dash\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, callback, Input, Output\n\ncomponent = html.Div([\n    dmc.Carousel(\n        [\n            dmc.CarouselSlide(dmc.Center(\"Slide-1\", bg=\"blue\", c=\"white\", p=60)),\n            dmc.CarouselSlide(dmc.Center(\"Slide-2\", bg=\"blue\", c=\"white\", p=60)),\n            dmc.CarouselSlide(dmc.Center(\"Slide-3\", bg=\"blue\", c=\"white\", p=60)),\n        ],\n        id=\"carousel-autoplay\",\n        mt=\"sm\",\n        emblaOptions={\"loop\": True},\n        autoplay=True,  # Default delay is 4000ms\n    )\n])\n```\nHere’s an example of passing props to the Embla component. In this example, the `delay` is set to 2000ms, and autoplay pauses when hovering over a slide:\n\n```python\nautoplay={\"delay\": 2000, \"stopOnMouseEnter\": True, \"stopOnInteraction\":False}\n\n```\n\n### Carousel Styles API\n\nCarousel supports Styles API, you can add styles to any inner element of the component with `classNames` prop. Refer to the  [Styles API documentation](/styles-api) to learn more.\n\n### Carousel Indicator styles\nThis example styles the indicators to emphasize the active slide.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Carousel(\n    [\n        dmc.CarouselSlide(dmc.Center(f\"Slide {i}\", bg=\"blue\", c=\"white\", h=\"100%\"))\n        for i in range(1, 4)\n    ],\n    id=\"carousel-indicator-styles\",\n    withIndicators=True,\n    height=200,\n    emblaOptions = {\"loop\": True},\n    classNames={\"indicator\": \"dmc-indicator\"},\n)\n```\nPut the following in a .css file in the `assets` folder:\n\n```css\n.dmc-indicator {\n  width: 12px;\n  height: 4px;\n  transition: width 250ms ease;\n\n  &[data-active] {\n    width: 40px;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Hide inactive controls\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Carousel(\n    [\n        dmc.CarouselSlide(dmc.Center(f\"Slide {i}\", bg=\"blue\", c=\"white\", h=\"100%\"))\n        for i in range(1, 4)\n    ],\n    id=\"carousel-hide-inactive-controls\",\n    height=200,\n    classNames={\"control\": \"dmc-control\"},\n)\n```\nPut the following in a .css file in the `assets` folder:\n\n```css\n.dmc-control {\n  &[data-inactive] {\n    opacity: 0;\n    cursor: default;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Show controls on hover\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Carousel(\n    [\n        dmc.CarouselSlide(dmc.Center(f\"Slide {i}\", bg=\"blue\", c=\"white\", h=\"100%\"))\n        for i in range(1, 4)\n    ],\n    id=\"carousel-show-controls-on-hover\",\n    height=200,\n    classNames={\"controls\": \"dmc-controls\", \"root\": \"dmc-root\"},\n)\n```\nPut the following in a .css file in the `assets` folder:\n```css\n\n.dmc-controls {\n  transition: opacity 150ms ease;\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n\n.dmc-root {\n  &:hover {\n    .dmc-controls {\n      opacity: 1;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Set initial slide\n\nTo set the initial slide to display, use the index number of the slide.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Input, Output, callback, no_update\n\ncomponent = dmc.Paper(\n    [\n        dmc.Select(\n            label=\"Set initial slide\",\n            data=[str(i) for i in range(6)],\n            value=\"0\",\n            id=\"carousel-input\",\n            mb=10,\n        ),\n        dmc.Carousel(\n            [\n                dmc.CarouselSlide(\n                    dmc.Center(\n                        f\"Slide {i}\", ta=\"center\", bg=\"blue\", c=\"white\", h=\"100%\"\n                    )\n                )\n                for i in range(6)\n            ],\n            id=\"carousel-initial\",\n            height=200,\n            emblaOptions = {\"loop\": True, \"align\": \"start\"},\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"carousel-initial\", \"initialSlide\"),\n    Input(\"carousel-input\", \"value\"),\n)\ndef go_to_slide(value):\n    return int(value)\n```\n### Container queries\nTo use container queries instead of media queries, set `type=\"container\"`. With container queries, slides size and gap \nwill be adjusted based on the container width, not the viewport width.\n\nNote that, when using container queries, `slideSize` and `slideGap` props cannot reference `theme.breakpoints` values \nin keys. It is required to use exact `px` or `em` values.\n\nTo see how the slides size and gap changes, resize the root element of the demo with the resize handle located at the\nbottom right corner of the demo:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    # Wrapper div is added for demonstration purposes only,\n    #  It is not required in real projects\n    dmc.Carousel(\n        [\n            dmc.CarouselSlide(dmc.Center(\"Slide-1\", bg=\"blue\", c=\"white\", p=60)),\n            dmc.CarouselSlide(dmc.Center(\"Slide-2\", bg=\"blue\", c=\"white\", p=60)),\n            dmc.CarouselSlide(dmc.Center(\"Slide-3\", bg=\"blue\", c=\"white\", p=60)),\n        ],\n        id=\"carousel-container\",\n        type=\"container\",\n        slideSize = {\"base\": '100%', '300px': '50%', '500px': '33.333333%'},\n        slideGap = {\"base\": 0, '300px': 'md', '500px': 'lg'},\n        emblaOptions = {\"loop\": True, \"align\": \"start\"},\n    ),\n    style={\n        \"resize\": 'horizontal',\n        \"overflow\": 'hidden',\n        \"maxWidth\": '100%',\n        \"minWidth\": 250,\n        \"padding\": 10,\n      }\n)\n```\n### Active prop for callbacks\n\nThe `active` prop represents the index of the currently displayed slide and can be used to trigger Dash callbacks. Note\nthat this prop is read-only. To set the initially displayed slide, use the `initialSlide` prop instead.\n\n\n### Example Image Carousel\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nimages = [\n    \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/images/bg-1.png\",\n    \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/images/bg-2.png\",\n    \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/images/bg-3.png\",\n    \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/images/bg-4.png\",\n    \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/images/bg-5.png\",\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.Carousel(\n    [dmc.CarouselSlide(dmc.Image(\"Slide 1\", src=image)) for image in images],\n    id=\"carousel-images\",\n    withIndicators=True,\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### Example Card Carousel\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\ndata = [\n    {\n        \"image\": \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1508193638397-1c4234db14d8?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=400&q=80\",\n        \"title\": \"Best forests to visit in North America\",\n        \"category\": \"NATURE\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"image\": \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559494007-9f5847c49d94?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=400&q=80\",\n        \"title\": \"Hawaii beaches review: better than you think\",\n        \"category\": \"BEACH\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"image\": \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1608481337062-4093bf3ed404?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=400&q=80\",\n        \"title\": \"Mountains at night: 12 best locations to enjoy the view\",\n        \"category\": \"NATURE\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"image\": \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510798831971-661eb04b3739?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=400&q=80\",\n        \"title\": \"Best places to visit this winter\",\n        \"category\": \"TOURISM\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"image\": \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1582721478779-0ae163c05a60?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=400&q=80\",\n        \"title\": \"Active volcanos reviews: travel at your own risk\",\n        \"category\": \"NATURE\",\n    },\n]\n\n\ndef make_card(image, title, category):\n    return dmc.Paper(\n        [\n            html.Div(\n                [\n                    dmc.Text(category, c=\"white\", opacity=0.7, fw=700),\n                    dmc.Title(title, lh=1.2, order=3, mt=\"xs\", fw=900, c=\"white\"),\n                ]\n            ),\n            dmc.Button(\"Read Article\", variant=\"white\", color=\"dark\"),\n        ],\n        shadow=\"md\",\n        p=\"xl\",\n        radius=\"md\",\n        style={\n            \"backgroundImage\": f\"url({image})\",\n            \"height\": 440,\n            \"display\": \"flex\",\n            \"flexDirection\": \"column\",\n            \"justifyContent\": \"space-between\",\n            \"alignItems\": \"flex-start\",\n            \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n            \"backgroundPosition\": \"center\",\n        },\n    )\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Carousel(\n    [dmc.CarouselSlide(make_card(d[\"image\"], d[\"title\"], d[\"category\"])) for d in data],\n    id=\"carousel-cards\",\n    w=400,\n    emblaOptions={\"loop\": True, \"align\": \"start\"},\n)\n```\n### Limitation: Carousel in Tabs\n\nWhen a Carousel is placed inside a tab, it may not render correctly. For more details, refer to [GitHub Issue #299]((https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/issues/299). \nAs a workaround, you can update the carousel within the tabs using a callback.\n\nBe sure to give a unique id to each carousel in the app.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, Input, Output, callback\n\n\ndef make_carousel(id):\n    return dmc.Carousel(\n        emblaOptions={\"loop\": True},\n        withIndicators=True,\n        children=[\n            dmc.CarouselSlide(\n                dmc.Center(\n                    slide,\n                    bg=\"blue\",\n                    c=\"white\",\n                    p=60,\n                )\n            )\n            for slide in [\"Slide 1\", \"Slide 2\", \"Slide 3\"]\n        ],\n        id=id,\n    )\n\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Tabs(\n            [\n                dmc.TabsList(\n                    [\n                        dmc.TabsTab(\"Tab one\", value=\"1\"),\n                        dmc.TabsTab(\"Tab two\", value=\"2\"),\n                    ]\n                ),\n            ],\n            id=\"tabs-carousel-example\",\n            value=\"1\",\n        ),\n        html.Div(id=\"tabs-carousel-content\", style={\"paddingTop\": 10}),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"tabs-carousel-content\", \"children\"), Input(\"tabs-carousel-example\", \"value\")\n)\ndef render_content(active):\n    if active == \"1\":\n        return [dmc.Text(\"Tab One selected\", my=10), make_carousel(\"carousel-tab1\")]\n    else:\n        return [dmc.Text(\"Tab Two selected\", my=10), make_carousel(\"carousel-tab2\")]\n```\n### Limitation: draggable and speed Props\nAs of DMC v0.14.7, the `draggable` and `speed` props no longer work because Embla Carousel v8 has removed them. These props\nwill be removed in DMC v1.0.0\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n\n#### Carousel selectors\n\n| Selector   | Static selector              | Description                                              |\n|------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| root       | .mantine-Carousel-root       | Root element                                             |\n| slide      | .mantine-Carousel-slide      | Carousel.Slide root element                              |\n| container  | .mantine-Carousel-container  | Slides container                                         |\n| viewport   | .mantine-Carousel-viewport   | Main element, contains slides container and all controls |\n| controls   | .mantine-Carousel-controls   | Next/previous controls container                         |\n| control    | .mantine-Carousel-control    | Next/previous control                                    |\n| indicators | .mantine-Carousel-indicators | Indicators container                                     |\n| indicator  | .mantine-Carousel-indicator  | Indicator button                                         |\n\n#### Carousel CSS variables\n\n| Selector | Variable                   | Description                                                |\n|----------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| root     | --carousel-control-size    | Controls `width` and `height` of the next/previous buttons |\n| root     | --carousel-controls-offset | Controls offsets of the next/previous buttons              |\n| root     | --carousel-height          | Controls height of the carousel                            |\n\n#### Carousel data attributes\n\n| Selector   | Attribute                    | Condition                                | Value                        |\n|------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| root       | data-orientation             | –                                        | Value of `orientation` prop  |\n| root       | data-include-gap-in-size     | `includeGapInSize` prop is set           | –                            |\n| control    | data-inactive                | No previous/next slides are available    | –                            |\n| indicator  | data-active                  | Associated slide is active               | –                            |\n\n\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### Carousel\n\n- children (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):\n    <Carousel.Slide /> components.\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- active (number; default 0):\n    The index of the current slide.

By default, the image will take 100% of parent width. The \nimage size can be controlled with `w` and `h` style props.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Image(\n    radius=\"md\",\n    src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/images/bg-7.png\",\n)\n```\n### Image height\n\nIn most case, you will need to set image height to prevent layout jumps when image is loading. You can do so with `h` [style](/style-props) props.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Image(\n    radius=\"md\",\n    h=200,\n    src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/images/bg-10.png\",\n)\n```\n### Image fit\nBy default the image has `object-fit: cover` style - it will resize to cover parent element. To change this behavior,\nset `w=\"auto\"` and `fit=\"contain\"` props.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Image(\n    radius=\"md\",\n    h=200,\n    w=\"auto\",\n    fit=\"contain\",\n    src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/images/bg-9.png\",\n)\n```\n### Placeholder\n\nSet `fallbackSrc` prop to display fallback image when image fails to load:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Image(\n    radius=\"md\",\n    src=None,\n    h=200,\n    fallbackSrc=\"https://placehold.co/600x400?text=Placeholder\",\n)\n```\n### Background Image\n\nUse BackgroundImage component when you need to display image below any content. Component sets background-image to \ngiven `src`, background-size to cover and background-position to center.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    style={\"width\": 300},\n    children=dmc.BackgroundImage(\n        src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1419242902214-272b3f66ee7a?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid\"\n        \"=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=720&q=80\",\n        children=[\n            dmc.Center(\n                p=\"md\",\n                children=[\n                    dmc.Text(\n                        \"BackgroundImage component can be used to add any content on image. It is used for cards, \"\n                        \"hero headers and similar components\",\n                        c=\"yellow\",\n                    )\n                ],\n            )\n        ],\n    ),\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

It does not have an input field.  \n\nNote: Many `DatePicker` props (for example,  `minDate`, `maxDate`, `excludeDates`, `allowLevelChange`, `firstDayOfWeek`,\n`renderDay`) apply across other Mantine date and time picker components. Refer to the DatePicker section for details and example for these shared props.\n\n\n### DatePickerInput\n\n[DatePickerInput](/components/datepickerinput): Select single dates, multiple dates (`type=\"multiple\"`), or date \nranges (`type=\"range\"`). This option **does not** allow free text input.\n\n\n### DateInput\n\n[DateInput](/components/datepickerinput): Allows free form text input of dates, as well as selecting a date from a calendar.\n\n\n### MonthPickerInput\n\n[MonthPickerInput](/components/monthpickerinput): Use when only the month value is needed.\n\n\n### YearPickerInput\n[YearPickerInput](/components/yearpickerinput): Use when only the year value is needed.\n\n### TimeInput\n[TimeInput](/components/timeinput): is based on the native `input[type=\"time\"]` element and does not support most of\nadvanced features like choosing time format or custom dropdown with time select. If you need more features, use\n`TimePicker` component instead.\n\n### TimePicker\n[TimePicker](/components/timepicker): Advanced time selection with features like dropdowns for hours, minutes, seconds,\nand 12-hour/24-hour formats, and time pre-sets.\n\n\n### TimeGrid\n[TimeGrid](/components/timegrid)  captures time value from the user with a predefined set of options.\n\n### DateTimePicker\n[DateTimePicker](/components/): Selects both date and time from user.\n\n### CSS Extensions\n\nAs of DMC 1.2.0, Date component styles are bundled automatically, so you no longer need to include a separate CSS file.\nIf you're using an older version of DMC, refer to the [migration guide](/migration) for instructions on including optional stylesheets."

    "category": "Date Pickers",
    "content": "\n\n## DateInput  \nFree form date input  \nCategory: Date Pickers  \n\n### DateInput props\n\nDateInput supports most of the [DatePicker](/components/datepicker) props, read through DatePicker\ndocumentation to learn about all component features that are not listed on this page.\n\n### Simple Example\n\nThis is a simple example of DateInput tied to a callback. You can type a date or select from the DatePicker\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Input, Output, html, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.DateInput(\n            id=\"dateinput2\",\n            label=\"Enter a date\",\n            description=\"You can type a date or select from the calendar\",\n            w=300,\n        ),\n        dmc.Space(h=10),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"selected-dateinput2\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"selected-dateinput2\", \"children\"), Input(\"dateinput2\", \"value\"))\ndef update_output(d):\n    prefix = \"You entered: \"\n    if d:\n        return prefix + d\n    else:\n        return \"\"\n```\n### Value format\n\n\nUse `valueFormat` prop to change [dayjs format](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) of value label displayed in the input field.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    gap=\"xl\",\n    children=[\n        dmc.DateInput(\n            value=datetime.now().date(),\n            valueFormat=\"ddd, MMM D YY\",\n            label=\"ddd, MMM D YY\",\n            w=250,\n        ),\n        dmc.DateInput(\n            value=datetime.now().date(),\n            valueFormat=\"MMMM DD, YY\",\n            label=\"MMMM DD, YY\",\n            w=250,\n        ),\n        dmc.DateInput(\n            value=datetime.now().date(),\n            valueFormat=\"DD-MM-YYYY\",\n            label=\"DD-MM-YYYY\",\n            w=250,\n        ),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Clearable\n\nSet clearable prop to allow removing value from the input. Input will be cleared if user selects the same date in dropdown or clears input value.\n\nWhen `clearable=True`, a clear button in the right section is displayed. Note that if you set rightSection prop, clear button will not be displayed.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.DateInput(\n    clearable=True, label=\"Date input\", placeholder=\"Date Input\", w=250\n)\n```\n### Min and max date\n\nSet `minDate` and `maxDate` props to define min and max dates. If date that is after `maxDate` or before `minDate` is entered, then it will be considered invalid and input value will be reverted to last known valid date value.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.DateInput(\n    minDate=datetime.now(),\n    maxDate=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=7),\n    placeholder=\"Date input\",\n    label=\"Select valid date\",\n    w=250,\n)\n```\n### Input props\n\n### CSS Extensions\n\nAs of DMC 1.2.0, Date component styles are bundled automatically, so you no longer need to include a separate CSS file.\nIf you're using an older version of DMC, refer to the [migration guide](/migration) for instructions on including optional stylesheets.\n\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n#### DateInput selectors\n\n| Selector                  | Static selector                                | Description

Try `DateInput` or `DatePickerInput`.\n\n### Simple Example\n\nThis is a simple example of `DatePicker` with a callback. Use a string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Input, Output, html, callback\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.DatePicker(id=\"date-picker\"),\n    dmc.Text(id=\"selected-date-picker\", mt=10),\n], align=\"center\")\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"selected-date-picker\", \"children\"), Input(\"date-picker\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update_output(d):\n    return f\"You selected {d}\"\n```\n### Allow deselect\nSet `allowDeselect` to allow user to deselect current selected date by clicking on it. `allowDeselect` is disregarded\nwhen `type` prop is `range` or `multiple`. When date is deselected the value is None.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Input, Output, html, callback\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.DatePicker(\n        id=\"date-picker-allow-deselect\",\n        allowDeselect=True\n    ),\n    dmc.Text(id=\"date-picker-out-allow-deselect\"),\n\n], align=\"center\")\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"date-picker-out-allow-deselect\", \"children\"), Input(\"date-picker-allow-deselect\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update_output(d):\n    return f\"You selected {d}\"\n```\n### Multiple dates\nSet `type=\"multiple\"` to allow user to pick multiple dates.  Note that value must be a list.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Input, Output, html, callback\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.DatePicker(\n        id=\"date-picker-multiple\",\n        value=[],\n        type=\"multiple\"\n    ),\n    dmc.Text(id=\"date-picker-out-multiple\"),\n\n], align=\"center\")\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"date-picker-out-multiple\", \"children\"), Input(\"date-picker-multiple\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update_output(d):\n    return f\"You selected {str(d)}\"\n```\n### Dates range\nSet `type=\"range\"` to allow user to pick dates range. Note that value must be a list.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Input, Output, html, callback\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.DatePicker(\n        id=\"date-picker-range\",\n        value=[],\n        type=\"range\"\n    ),\n    dmc.Text(id=\"date-picker-out-range\"),\n\n], align=\"center\")\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"date-picker-out-range\", \"children\"), Input(\"date-picker-range\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update_output(d):\n    return f\"You selected {str(d)}\"\n```\n### Single date in range\nBy default, it is not allowed to select single date as range – when user clicks the same date second time it is\ndeselected. To change this behavior set `allowSingleDateInRange=True` prop. `allowSingleDateInRange` is ignored \nwhen type prop is not range.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Input, Output, html, callback\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.DatePicker(\n        id=\"date-picker-range-s\",\n        value=[],\n        type=\"range\",\n        allowSingleDateInRange=True\n    ),\n    dmc.Text(id=\"date-picker-out-range-s\"),\n\n], align=\"center\")\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"date-picker-out-range-s\", \"children\"), Input(\"date-picker-range-s\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update_output(d):\n    return f\"You selected {str(d)}\"\n```\n### Presets\nUse `presets` prop to add custom date presets. Presets are displayed next to the calendar:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date, timedelta\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ntoday = date.today()\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    dmc.DatePicker(\n        presets=[\n            {\n                \"value\": (today - timedelta(days=1)).isoformat(),\n                \"label\": \"Yesterday\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": today.isoformat(),\n                \"label\": \"Today\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": (today + timedelta(days=1)).isoformat(),\n                \"label\": \"Tomorrow\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": (today + relativedelta(months=1)).isoformat(),\n                \"label\": \"Next month\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": (today + relativedelta(years=1)).isoformat(),\n                \"label\": \"Next year\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": (today - relativedelta(months=1)).isoformat(),\n                \"label\": \"Last month\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": (today - relativedelta(years=1)).isoformat(),\n                \"label\": \"Last year\",\n            },\n        ]\n    )\n)\n```\nTo use `presets` with `type=\"range\"`, define value a tuple of two dates:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date, timedelta\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ntoday = date.today()\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    dmc.DatePicker(\n        type=\"range\",\n        presets=[\n            {\n                \"value\": [\n                    (today - timedelta(days=2)).isoformat(),\n                    today.isoformat(),\n                ],\n                \"label\": \"Last two days\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": [\n                    (today - timedelta(days=7)).isoformat(),\n                    today.isoformat(),\n                ],\n                \"label\": \"Last 7 days\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": [\n                    today.replace(day=1).isoformat(),\n                    today.isoformat(),\n                ],\n                \"label\": \"This month\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": [\n                    (today - relativedelta(months=1)).replace(day=1).isoformat(),\n                    (today.replace(day=1) - timedelta(days=1)).isoformat(),\n                ],\n                \"label\": \"Last month\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": [\n                    date(today.year - 1, 1, 1).isoformat(),\n                    date(today.year - 1, 12, 31).isoformat(),\n                ],\n                \"label\": \"Last year\",\n            },\n        ],\n    )\n)\n```\n### Default date\n\nUse `defaultDate` prop to set date value that will be used to determine which year should be displayed initially. For \nexample to display 2015 February month set `defaultDate=\"2015-02-01\"`. If value is not specified, then defaultDate will\nuse today's date. Day, minutes and seconds are ignored in provided date, only year and month data is used – you can \nspecify any date value.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    dmc.DatePicker(defaultDate=\"2015-02-01\")\n)\n```\n### Level\nSet `level` prop to configure initial level that will be displayed:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group([\n    dmc.DatePicker(level=\"decade\"),\n    dmc.DatePicker(level=\"year\")\n], justify=\"center\")\n```\n### Hide outside dates\nSet `hideOutsideDates=True` to remove all dates that do not belong to the current month:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    dmc.DatePicker(hideOutsideDates=True)\n)\n```\n### Display week numbers\nSet `withWeekNumbers=True` to display week numbers:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    dmc.DatePicker(withWeekNumbers=True)\n)\n```\n### First day of week\nSet `firstDayOfWeek` prop to configure first day of week. The prop accepts number from 0 to 6, where 0 is Sunday and 6\nis Saturday. Default value is 1 – Monday. You can also configure this option for all components with `DatesProvider`.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group([\n    dmc.DatePicker(firstDayOfWeek=0),\n    dmc.DatePicker(firstDayOfWeek=6)\n], justify=\"center\", gap=\"xl\")\n```\n### Hide weekdays\nSet `hideWeekdays=True` to hide weekdays names:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    dmc.DatePicker(hideWeekdays=True)\n)\n```\n### Weekend days\nUse `weekendDays` prop to configure weekend days. The prop accepts an array of numbers from 0 to 6, where 0 is\nSunday and 6 is Saturday. Default value is `[0, 6]` – Saturday and Sunday. You can also configure this option for\nall components with DatesProvider.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    dmc.DatePicker(weekendDays=[1,2])\n)\n```\n### Min and max date\nSet `minDate` and `maxDate` props to define min and max dates. If previous/next page is not available then \ncorresponding control will be disabled.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    dmc.DatePicker(\n        minDate=\"2025-05-10\",\n        maxDate = \"2025-05-25\"\n    )\n)\n```\n### Change header controls order\nUse `headerControlsOrder` prop to change order of header controls. The prop accepts a list of 'next' | 'previous' | 'level'.\nNote that each control can be used only once in the list.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.DatePicker(\n    value=\"2025-02-01\",\n    headerControlsOrder = ['level', 'previous', 'next'],\n    styles = {\n        \"calendarHeaderLevel\": {\n            \"justifyContent\": 'flex-start',\n            \"paddingInlineStart\": 8,\n        },\n    }\n)\n```\n### Add props to year and month control\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n  \n\nYou can add props to year, month and day controls with `getYearControlProps`, `getMonthControlProps` and `getDayProps`\nfunctions. All functions accept date as single argument, props returned from the function will be added to\nyear/month/day control. For example, it can be used to disable specific control or add styles:\n\n\n```python\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n# Adding dayjs as external script to make it available to the function\n# app = Dash(external_scripts=[\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dayjs/1.10.8/dayjs.min.js\"])\n\ncomponent = dmc.DatePicker(\n    defaultDate=\"2025-06-01\",\n    getDayProps={\"function\": \"highlightFriday13\"},\n    getYearControlProps={\"function\": \"yearControlProps\"},\n    getMonthControlProps={\"function\": \"monthControlProps\"},\n    my=\"lg\"\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\n// dayjs is loaded globally via Dash external_scripts.\n// For details, see DatesProvider docs: https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/components/datesprovider\nvar dayjs = window.dayjs;\n\ndmcfuncs.highlightFriday13 = function (dateStr) {\n  const d = dayjs(dateStr);\n\n  if (d.day() === 5 && d.date() === 13) {\n    return {\n      style: {\n        backgroundColor: 'var(--mantine-color-red-filled)',\n        color: 'var(--mantine-color-white)',\n      },\n    };\n  }\n\n  return {};\n};\n\ndmcfuncs.yearControlProps = function (dateStr) {\n  const d = dayjs(dateStr);\n  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();\n\n  if (d.year() === currentYear) {\n    return {\n      style: {\n        color: 'var(--mantine-color-blue-filled)',\n        fontWeight: 700,\n      },\n    };\n  }\n\n  if (d.year() === currentYear + 1) {\n    return { disabled: true };\n  }\n\n  return {};\n};\n\ndmcfuncs.monthControlProps = function (dateStr) {\n  const d = dayjs(dateStr);\n\n  if (d.month() === 1) {\n    return {\n      style: {\n        color: 'var(--mantine-color-blue-filled)',\n        fontWeight: 700,\n      },\n    };\n  }\n\n  if (d.month() === 5) {\n    return { disabled: true };\n  }\n\n  return {};\n};\n```\n\n\n### Render day function\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n  \n\nYou can customize day rendering with renderDay prop. For example, it can be used to add `Indicator` to certain days.\n\n\n```python\nfrom dash import Dash\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\n# Adding dayjs as external script to make it available to the function\n# app = Dash(external_scripts=[\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dayjs/1.10.8/dayjs.min.js\"])\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.DatePicker(\n    id=\"custom-day-render\",\n    renderDay={\"function\": \"highlightSixteenthWithDot\"}\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\nvar dmc = window.dash_mantine_components;\nvar dayjs = window.dayjs;\n\ndmcfuncs.highlightSixteenthWithDot = function (dateStr) {\n  const day = dayjs(dateStr).date();\n\n  return React.createElement(\n    dmc.Indicator,\n    {\n      size: 9,\n      color: \"red\",\n      offset: -5,\n      disabled: day !== 16, // displays indicator only on the the 16th doy of the month\n    },\n    React.createElement(\"div\", null, day)\n  );\n};\n```\n\n\n### Disabled dates\n\n#### Example 1: A List of dates\nUse the `disabledDates` prop to pass a list of specific dates to disable. Dates must be strings in the YYYY-MM-DD format.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    dmc.DatePicker(\n        value=\"2024-11-05\",\n        defaultDate=\"2024-11-01\",\n        disabledDates=[\"2024-11-06\", \"2024-11-07\",  \"2024-11-08\"],\n        m=\"lg\"\n    )\n)\n```\n#### Example 2: A Function\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n  \n\nThe `disabledDates` prop accepts a function that receives a date string (in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format) and returns true if the date should be disabled.\n\nThis example uses [dayjs](https://day.js.org/) to simplify working with dates in JavaScript.\n\nTo use `dayjs` in your Dash app, load it as an external script:\n\n```python\napp = Dash(external_scripts=[\n    \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dayjs/1.10.8/dayjs.min.js\"\n])\n```\n\nHere, `dayjs(dateStr).day()` is used to check the day of the week. This is more reliable than manually parsing the date string and helps avoid common timezone issues.\n\nThe example below disables all dates except Fridays:\n\n\n```python\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n# makes dayjs available\n#app = Dash(exteral_scripts=[\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dayjs/1.10.8/dayjs.min.js\"])\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    dmc.DatePicker(\n        value=\"2024-11-08\",\n        defaultDate=\"2024-11-01\",\n        disabledDates={\"function\": \"excludeDate\"},\n        m=\"lg\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.excludeDate = function(dateStr) {\n   const date = dayjs(dateStr, \"YYYY-MM-DD\");\n   return date.isValid() && date.day() !== 5;\n}\n```\n\n\n### Number of columns\nSet `numberOfColumns` prop to define number of pickers that will be rendered side by side:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    dmc.DatePicker(numberOfColumns=2)\n)\n```\n### Max level\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group([\n    dmc.DatePicker(maxLevel=\"year\"),\n    dmc.DatePicker(maxLevel=\"month\")\n], justify=\"center\", gap=\"xl\")\n```\n### Change year and months controls format\nUse `yearsListFormat` and `monthsListFormat` props to change [dayjs](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) format of year/month controls:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    dmc.DatePicker(monthsListFormat=\"MM\", yearsListFormat=\"YY\")\n)\n```\n### Change label format\nUse `decadeLabelFormat`, `yearLabelFormat` and `monthLabelFormat` props to change  [dayjs](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format)\nformat of decade/year label:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    dmc.DatePicker(\n        decadeLabelFormat=\"YY\",\n        yearLabelFormat=\"YYYY [year]\",\n        monthLabelFormat=\"MM/YY\",\n    )\n)\n```\n### Localization\n\nFor information on setting locale, have a look at the [DatesProvider](/components/datesprovider) component.\n\n\n### CSS Extensions\n\nAs of DMC 1.2.0, Date component styles are bundled automatically, so you no longer need to include a separate CSS file.\nIf you're using an older version of DMC, refer to the [migration guide](/migration) for instructions on including optional stylesheets.\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n\n#### DatePicker Selectors\n\n| Selector                  | Static selector                                 | Description

Helps you easily switch between different months, years along with locale support.  \nCategory: Date Pickers  \n\n### Simple Example\n\nThis is a simple example of `DatePickerInput` tied to a callback. You can either use strings in a valid datetime format such\nas `YYYY-MM-DD` or use the date object from datetime library.\n\n> If you would like to enable the user to type a date manually into the input field, please use the `DateInput` component\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, date\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Input, Output, html, callback\nfrom dash.exceptions import PreventUpdate\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.DatePickerInput(\n            id=\"date-picker-input\",\n            label=\"Start Date\",\n            description=\"You can also provide a description\",\n            minDate=date(2020, 8, 5),\n            value=datetime.now().date(),  # or string in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n            w=250,\n        ),\n        dmc.Space(h=10),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"selected-date-input\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"selected-date-input\", \"children\"), Input(\"date-picker-input\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update_output(d):\n    prefix = \"You have selected: \"\n    if d:\n        return prefix + d\n    else:\n        raise PreventUpdate\n```\n### Multiple dates\n\nSet type=\"multiple\" to allow user to pick multiple dates.  Note that `value` is a list.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, date, timedelta\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Input, Output, html, callback, no_update\n\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.DatePickerInput(\n            id=\"date-picker-input-multiple\",\n            label=\"Pick dates\",\n            description=\"Pick one or more dates\",\n            minDate=date(2020, 8, 5),\n            value=[datetime.now().date(), datetime.now().date() + timedelta(days=5)],\n            w=400,\n            type=\"multiple\",\n            placeholder=\"Pick dates\",\n            maw=300,\n            clearable=True,\n        ),\n        dmc.Space(h=10),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"selected-date-input-multiple\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"selected-date-input-multiple\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"date-picker-input-multiple\", \"value\"),\n)\ndef update_output(dates):\n    prefix = \"You have selected: \"\n    if dates:\n        return prefix + \",   \".join(dates)\n    else:\n        return no_update\n```\n### Dates range\n\nSet type=\"range\" to allow user to pick dates range. Note that `value` is a list.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, date\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Input, Output, html, callback\nfrom dash.exceptions import PreventUpdate\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.DatePickerInput(\n            id=\"date-input-range-picker\",\n            label=\"Date Range\",\n            description=\"Select a date range\",\n            minDate=date(2020, 8, 5),\n            type=\"range\",\n            value=[datetime.now().date(), datetime.now().date() + timedelta(days=5)],\n            maw=300,\n        ),\n        dmc.Space(h=10),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"selected-date-input-range-picker\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"selected-date-input-range-picker\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"date-input-range-picker\", \"value\"),\n)\ndef update_output(dates):\n    prefix = \"You have selected from \"\n    if None not in dates:\n        return prefix + \"   to   \".join(dates)\n    else:\n        raise PreventUpdate\n```\n### Presets\n\nUse `presets` prop to add custom date presets. Presets are displayed next to the calendar:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date, timedelta\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ntoday = date.today()\n\ncomponent = dmc.DatePickerInput(\n    label=\"With presets\",\n    placeholder=\"Select date\",\n    presets=[\n        {\n            \"value\": (today - timedelta(days=1)).isoformat(),\n            \"label\": \"Yesterday\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"value\": today.isoformat(),\n            \"label\": \"Today\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"value\": (today + timedelta(days=1)).isoformat(),\n            \"label\": \"Tomorrow\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"value\": (today + relativedelta(months=1)).isoformat(),\n            \"label\": \"Next month\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"value\": (today + relativedelta(years=1)).isoformat(),\n            \"label\": \"Next year\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"value\": (today - relativedelta(months=1)).isoformat(),\n            \"label\": \"Last month\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"value\": (today - relativedelta(years=1)).isoformat(),\n            \"label\": \"Last year\",\n        },\n    ],\n    maw=200\n)\n```\nTo use `presets` with `type=\"range\"`, define value a tuple of two dates:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date, timedelta\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ntoday = date.today()\n\ncomponent = dmc.DatePickerInput(\n    type=\"range\",\n    label=\"With presets\",\n    placeholder=\"Select date\",\n    presets=[\n        {\n            \"value\": [\n                (today - timedelta(days=2)).isoformat(),\n                today.isoformat(),\n            ],\n            \"label\": \"Last two days\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"value\": [\n                (today - timedelta(days=7)).isoformat(),\n                today.isoformat(),\n            ],\n            \"label\": \"Last 7 days\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"value\": [\n                today.replace(day=1).isoformat(),\n                today.isoformat(),\n            ],\n            \"label\": \"This month\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"value\": [\n                (today - relativedelta(months=1)).replace(day=1).isoformat(),\n                (today.replace(day=1) - timedelta(days=1)).isoformat(),\n            ],\n            \"label\": \"Last month\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"value\": [\n                date(today.year - 1, 1, 1).isoformat(),\n                date(today.year - 1, 12, 31).isoformat(),\n            ],\n            \"label\": \"Last year\",\n        },\n    ],\n    maw=320\n)\n```\n### Open picker in modal\n\nBy default, `DatePickerInput` is rendered inside `Popover`. You can change that to `Modal` by setting `dropdownType=\"modal\"`\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.DatePickerInput(\n    value=datetime.now().date(),\n    dropdownType=\"modal\",\n    w=200,\n)\n```\n### Number of columns\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.DatePickerInput(w=250, type=\"range\", numberOfColumns=2)\n```\n### Value format\n\nUse `valueFormat` prop to change [dayjs format](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) of value label.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    gap=\"xl\",\n    children=[\n        dmc.DatePickerInput(\n            value=datetime.now().date(),\n            valueFormat=\"ddd, MMM D YY\",\n            label=\"ddd, MMM D YY\",\n            w=200,\n        ),\n        dmc.DatePickerInput(\n            value=datetime.now().date(),\n            valueFormat=\"MMMM DD, YY\",\n            label=\"MMMM DD, YY\",\n            w=200,\n        ),\n        dmc.DatePickerInput(\n            value=datetime.now().date(),\n            valueFormat=\"DD-MM-YYYY\",\n            label=\"DD-MM-YYYY\",\n            w=200,\n        ),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Clearable\n\nSet `clearable=True` prop to display clear button in the right section. Note that if you set `rightSection` prop, clear button will not be displayed.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.DatePickerInput(\n            value=datetime.now().date(),\n            label=\"Date not clearable\",\n            w=200,\n        ),\n        dmc.DatePickerInput(\n            value=datetime.now().date(),\n            label=\"Date clearable\",\n            w=200,\n            clearable=True,\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Error Display\n\nYou can convey errors in your date picker by setting the `error` prop. For instance, in the below example we try to\nconvey the user that it's a required field and the date can't be an odd date. Since it's a required field, we also\nset `clearable=False`.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, callback\n\ncomponent = dmc.DatePickerInput(\n    id=\"datepickerinput-error\",\n    value=datetime.now().date(),\n    label=\"Date\",\n    required=True,\n    clearable=False,\n    w=200,\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"datepickerinput-error\", \"error\"), Input(\"datepickerinput-error\", \"value\"))\ndef datepicker_error(date):\n    day = datetime.strptime(date, \"%Y-%M-%d\").day\n    return \"Please select an even date.\" if day % 2 else \"\"\n```\n### Localization\n\nFor information on setting locale, have a look at the [DatesProvider](/components/datesprovider) component.\n\n\n### CSS Extensions\n\nAs of DMC 1.2.0, Date component styles are bundled automatically, so you no longer need to include a separate CSS file.\nIf you're using an older version of DMC, refer to the [migration guide](/migration) for instructions on including optional stylesheets.\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n\n#### DatePickerInput selectors\n\n| Selector                  | Static selector                                      |

    "content": "\n\n## DateTimePicker  \nCapture datetime from the user  \nCategory: Date Pickers  \n\n### DatePicker props\n`DateTimePicker` supports most of the `DatePicker` props, read through [DatePicker](/components/datepicker) documentation to learn about all component features that are not listed on this page.\n\n### Simple Example\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Input, Output, html, callback, no_update\n\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.DateTimePicker(\n            id=\"datetime-picker\",\n            label=\"Start Date and time\",\n            description=\"You can also provide a description\",\n            w=250,\n        ),\n        dmc.Space(h=10),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"selected-datetime\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"selected-datetime\", \"children\"), Input(\"datetime-picker\", \"value\"))\ndef update_output(d):\n    return f\"You have selected {d}\"\n```\n### With Seconds\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.DateTimePicker(\n    label=\"Pick date and time\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick date and time\",\n    withSeconds=True,\n)\n```\n### Presets\n\nUse `presets` prop to add custom date presets. Presets are displayed next to the calendar:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\nnow = datetime.now()\n\ncomponent = dmc.DateTimePicker(\n    label=\"Pick date and time\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick date and time\",\n    presets=[\n        {\n            \"value\": (now - timedelta(days=1)).isoformat(),\n            \"label\": \"Yesterday\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"value\": now.isoformat(),\n            \"label\": \"Today\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"value\": (now + timedelta(days=1)).isoformat(),\n            \"label\": \"Tomorrow\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"value\": (now + relativedelta(months=1)).isoformat(),\n            \"label\": \"Next month\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"value\": (now + relativedelta(years=1)).isoformat(),\n            \"label\": \"Next year\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"value\": (now - relativedelta(months=1)).isoformat(),\n            \"label\": \"Last month\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"value\": (now - relativedelta(years=1)).isoformat(),\n            \"label\": \"Last year\",\n        },\n    ]\n)\n```\n### TimePicker props\nYou can pass props down to the underlying [TimePicker](//components/timepicker) component with `timePickerProps` prop. Example of enabling \ndropdown and setting 12h format for time picker:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.DateTimePicker(\n    label=\"Pick date and time\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick Date and time\",\n    timePickerProps={\n        \"withDropdown\": True,\n        \"popoverProps\": { \"withinPortal\": False },\n        \"format\": '12h',\n      }\n)\n```\n### Value format\n\nUse `valueFormat` prop to change [dayjs format](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) of value label.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.DateTimePicker(\n    valueFormat=\"DD MMM YYYY hh:mm A\",\n    label=\"Pick date and time (Value Formatter)\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick date and time\",\n)\n```\n### Disabled state\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.DateTimePicker(\n    disabled=True,\n    label=\"Pick date and time (Disabled)\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick date and time\",\n)\n```\n### Input props\n\n### Clearable\n\nSet `clearable=True` prop to display clear button in the right section. Note that if you set `rightSection` prop, clear button will not be displayed.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.DateTimePicker(\n    clearable=True,\n    value=\"2025-01-01\",\n    label=\"Pick date and time (clearable)\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick Date and time\",\n)\n```\n### Open picker in modal\n\nBy default, `DateTimePicker` is rendered inside `Popover`. You can change that to `Modal` by setting `dropdownType=\"modal\"`\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.DateTimePicker(\n    dropdownType=\"modal\",\n    label=\"Pick date and time (picker in modal)\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick date and time\",\n)\n```\n### CSS Extensions\n\nAs of DMC 1.2.0, Date component styles are bundled automatically, so you no longer need to include a separate CSS file.\nIf you're using an older version of DMC, refer to the [migration guide](/migration) for instructions on including optional stylesheets.\n\n\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

DatesProvider supports the following settings:\n\n- `locale` – dayjs locale, note that you also need to import corresponding locale module from dayjs. Default value is en.\n- `firstDayOfWeek` – number from 0 to 6, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday. Default value is 1 – Monday.\n- `weekendDays` – an array of numbers from 0 to 6, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday. Default value is [0, 6] – Saturday and Sunday.\n- `consistentWeeks` – boolean, if true every month will have 6 weeks. Default value is false.\n\n\n\n### Locale\n\nDatePicker component uses [dayjs](https://day.js.org) behind the scenes. So you can easily customize locale by including\nrequired locale data and setting the `locale`. Make sure to include proper localization file from dayjs library.\n\n - [dayjs internationalization](https://day.js.org/docs/en/i18n/i18n)\n - [Loading locale in the browser](https://day.js.org/docs/en/installation/browser#cdn-resource)\n - [Supported locales](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs/tree/dev/src/locale)\n\n```python\nfrom dash import Dash\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nscripts = [\n    \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dayjs/1.10.8/dayjs.min.js\",      # dayjs  \n    \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dayjs/1.10.8/locale/fr.min.js\",  # french locale\n]\n\napp = Dash(external_scripts=scripts)\n```\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.DatesProvider(\n    children=dmc.Stack(\n        [\n            dmc.DatePickerInput(\n                w=250,\n                label=\"Sélectionner une date\",\n            ),\n            dmc.DatePickerInput(\n                w=250,\n                label=\"Sélectionner une autre date\",\n            ),\n        ]\n    ),\n    settings={\"locale\": \"fr\", \"firstDayOfWeek\": 0, \"weekendDays\": [0]},\n)\n```\n### Consistent weeks\nIf you want to avoid layout shifts, set `consistentWeeks=True` in `DatesProvider` settings. This will make sure that \nevery month has 6 weeks, even if outside days are not in the same month.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.DatesProvider(\n    children=dmc.DatePickerInput(\n                h=400,\n                popoverProps={\n                    \"opened\": True,\n                    \"position\": \"bottom\",\n                    \"middlewares\":{ \"flip\": False, \"shift\": False }\n                }\n            ),\n    settings={\"consistentWeeks\": True},\n)\n```\n### Keyword Arguments\n\n#### DatesProvider\n\n- children (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional)\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- settings (dict; required)\n\n    `settings` is a dict with keys:"

    "content": "\n\n## MiniCalendar  \nCompact calendar to display a small number of days in a row  \nCategory: Date Pickers  \n\n### Simple Example\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.MiniCalendar(\n        defaultDate=\"2025-01-02\",\n        value=\"2025-01-03\",\n        id=\"mini-calendar\"\n    ),\n    dmc.Text(id=\"mini-calendar-date\", m=\"md\")\n])\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"mini-calendar-date\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"mini-calendar\", \"value\"),\n)\ndef update(d):\n    return f\"You selected: {d}\"\n```\n### Number of days\n\nUse numberOfDays prop to control how many days are displayed at once. The default value is 7.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MiniCalendar(numberOfDays=5)\n```\n### getDayProps\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n  \n\nUse `getDayProps` to add custom props to days, for example, assign styles to weekends:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MiniCalendar(\n    numberOfDays=8,\n    getDayProps={\"function\":\"weekendRed\"}\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\n// dayjs is loaded globally via Dash external_scripts.\n// For details, see DatesProvider docs: https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/components/datesprovider\nvar dayjs = window.dayjs;\n\ndmcfuncs.weekendRed = function (dateStr) {\n  const d = dayjs(dateStr);\n\n  if ([0, 6].includes(d.day())) {\n    return {\n      style: {\n        color: 'var(--mantine-color-red-8)',\n      },\n    };\n  }\n\n  return {};\n};\n```\n\n\n### Min and max dates\nUse `minDate` and `maxDate` props to limit date selection:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MiniCalendar(\n    numberOfDays=6,\n    defaultDate=\"2025-04-13\",\n    minDate = \"2025-04-14\",\n    maxDate = \"2025-04-24\",\n)\n```\n### Localization\nYou can change localization both on component level with locale prop and globally with [DatesProvider](/components/datesprovider).\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.DatesProvider(\n    dmc.MiniCalendar(locale=\"fr\", defaultDate=\"2025-04-01\"),\n    settings={\"locale\": \"fr\"}\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\nHere’s your content reformatted as Markdown tables:\n\n#### MiniCalendar selectors\n\n| Selector  | Static selector                   | Description                                                                |\n| --------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| root      | `.mantine-MiniCalendar-root`      | Root element                                                               |\n| control   | `.mantine-MiniCalendar-control`   | Button in the dropdown which is used to select hours/minutes/seconds/am-pm |\n| days      | `.mantine-MiniCalendar-days`      | Days container                                                             |\n| day       | `.mantine-MiniCalendar-day`       | Single day element                                                         |\n| dayMonth  | `.mantine-MiniCalendar-dayMonth`  | Day element in month view                                                  |\n| dayNumber | `.mantine-MiniCalendar-dayNumber` | Day number element                                                         |\n\n---\n\n#### MiniCalendar CSS variables\n\n| Selector | Variable                    | Description                                       |\n| -------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| root     | `--mini-calendar-font-size` | Controls size of all elements (based on em units) |\n\n---\n\n#### MiniCalendar data attributes\n\n| Selector | Attribute | Condition                                              | Value                |\n| -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |\n| control  | disabled  | Next/previous range is after maxDate or before minDate | –                    |\n| control  | direction | –                                                      | `previous` or `next` |\n| day      | selected  | The day matches the value                              | –                    |\n| day      | disabled  | The day is before minDate or after maxDate             | –                    |\n\n---\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### MiniCalendar\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

    "content": "\n\n## TimeGrid  \nCaptures time value from the user with a predefined set of options.  \nCategory: Date Pickers  \n\n### Simple Example\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.TimeGrid(\n        timeRangeData={\"startTime\": \"10:00\", \"endTime\": \"21:00\", \"interval\": \"01:00\"},\n        withSeconds=False,\n        simpleGridProps={\n            \"type\": \"container\",\n            \"cols\": {\"base\": 1, \"180px\": 2, \"320px\": 3},\n            \"spacing\": \"xs\",\n        },\n        value=\"10:00:00\",\n        id=\"time-grid\"\n    ),\n    dmc.Text(id=\"time-grid-out\")\n])\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"time-grid-out\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"time-grid\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update(value):\n    return f\"You selected: {value}\"\n```\n### format, withSeconds, size, radius\n\n### data prop\n`data` prop accepts an array of time values in 24-hour format. Values must be unique.\n\n```python\ndmc.TimeGrid(\n    data=['10:00', '12:00']\n)\n```\n\n### timeRangeData prop\n\nUse the `timeRangeData` prop to generate a range of times. It accepts a dictionary with `startTime`,\n`endTime`, and `interval` keys, where all values are strings in `hh:mm:ss` format. This overrides any values provided \ndirectly in the `data` prop.\n\n```python\ndmc.TimeGrid(\n    timeRangeData={\"startTime\": \"10:00\", \"endTime\": \"21:00\", \"interval\": \"01:00\"},\n)\n```\n\n### Min and max time\nSet `minTime` and `maxTime` props to limit available time range. Both props accept time values in 24-hour format:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TimeGrid(\n    timeRangeData={\"startTime\": \"09:00\", \"endTime\": \"22:00\", \"interval\": \"01:00\"},\n    minTime=\"11:00\",\n    maxTime=\"18:00\",\n    withSeconds=False,\n)\n```\n### Disable time values\nYou can disable specific time values by providing an array of disabled values to the `disableTime` prop:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TimeGrid(\n    timeRangeData={\"startTime\": \"09:00\", \"endTime\": \"11:45\", \"interval\": \"00:15\"},\n    disableTime = ['10:45', '11:00', '11:30']\n)\n```\n### Allow deselect\nSet `allowDeselect` prop to allow deselecting time value by clicking on the control with selected value:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TimeGrid(\n    timeRangeData={\"startTime\": \"09:00\", \"endTime\": \"12:00\", \"interval\": \"01:00\"},\n    value=\"11:00\",\n    allowDeselect=True\n)\n```\n### Change AM/PM Labels\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TimeGrid(\n    timeRangeData={\"startTime\": \"09:00\", \"endTime\": \"22:00\", \"interval\": \"01:00\"},\n    format=\"12h\",\n    amPmLabels={\"am\": 'पूर्वाह्न', \"pm\": 'अपराह्न'}\n)\n```\n### Disabled\nSet `disabled` prop to disable all controls:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TimeGrid(\n    timeRangeData={\"startTime\": \"09:00\", \"endTime\": \"22:00\", \"interval\": \"01:00\"},\n    disabled=True\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element.

You can enter a valid time string such as hh:mm:ss.\n\nUse the  `withSeconds` prop to display seconds.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nimport datetime\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    gap=50,\n    children=[\n        dmc.TimeInput(label=\"What time is it now?\"),\n        dmc.TimeInput(\n            label=\"What time is it now?\",\n            withSeconds=True,\n            value=\"23:15:45\",\n        ),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### TimePicker component\nTimeInput component is based on the native `input[type=\"time\"]` element and does not support most of advanced features\nlike choosing time format or custom dropdown with time select. If you need more features, use [TimePicker](/components/timepicker) \ncomponent instead.\n\n`TimeInput` features/limitations:\n\n- Native `input[type=\"time\"]` element\n- Native browser controls for time selection on mobile devices\n- Time format depends on the user's locale\n- Only native dropdown with hours/minutes/seconds, does not work in Firefox\n- Mobile Safari does not provide an option to select seconds\n\n\n### Input Props\n\nTimeInput supports all props from Input and InputWrapper components such as `radius`, `size`, `required`, etc.\n\n### With icon\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.TimeInput(leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"bi:clock\"))\n```\n### Invalid State And Error\n\nYou can display an error with a red border and add an error message.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    children=[\n        dmc.TimeInput(label=\"Enter Time:\", w=100, error=True),\n        dmc.TimeInput(\n            label=\"Enter Time:\",\n            w=150,\n            error=\"Enter a valid time\",\n            withSeconds=True,\n        ),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

    "content": "\n\n## TimePicker  \nUse the TimeInput component to capture time input from user.  \nCategory: Date Pickers  \n\n### Usage\n\n`TimePicker` component is an alternative to [TimeInput](/components/timeinput) that offers more features, it supports \n24-hour and 12-hour formats, dropdown with hours, minutes and seconds, and more.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    gap=50,\n    children=[\n        dmc.TimePicker(label=\"Enter a time\", id=\"timepicker-usage\"),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"out-timepicker\")\n    ],\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"out-timepicker\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"timepicker-usage\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update(value):\n    return f\"You entered: {value}\"\n```\n### With callbacks\n\n`TimePicker` component value is a string in hh:mm:ss 24-hour format (for example 18:34:55). Empty string is used to\nrepresent no value. The `value` props is updated when the entered value is valid. The input value is considered valid\nin the following cases:\n\n- All inputs are empty. In this case the `value` will be  an empty string.\n- All inputs are filled. For example if `withSeconds` prop is set and the user entered 12:34:56, the value will be\n12:34:56. But if the user entered 12:34, `value` will not be updated because seconds value is missing.\n- If a complete, valid time has been entered, the value will update as the user changes any part of it (hours, minutes,\nor seconds). Each digit change will immediately reflect in the updated value.\n\n### Debounce\n\nTo control how often the input's value is updated while the user is typing, use the `debounce` prop:\n\n- Set `debounce=True` to update the value only when the user finishes typing and moves focus away (i.e. on blur).\n- Set `debounce=<milliseconds>` to update the value after a specified delay from the user's last keystroke. For example,\n`debounce=300` will wait 300 milliseconds after the user stops typing before updating the value.\n\n#### Example debounce=True\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    gap=50,\n    children=[\n        dmc.TimePicker(\n            label=\"Enter a time\",\n            debounce=True,\n            id=\"timepicker-debounce\"\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"out-timepicker-debounce\")\n    ],\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"out-timepicker-debounce\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"timepicker-debounce\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update(value):\n    return f\"You entered: {value}\"\n```\n#### Example debounce=1000\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    gap=50,\n    children=[\n        dmc.TimePicker(\n            label=\"Enter a time\",\n            debounce=1000,\n            id=\"timepicker-debounce-ms\"\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"out-timepicker-debounce-ms\")\n    ],\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"out-timepicker-debounce-ms\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"timepicker-debounce-ms\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update(value):\n    return f\"You entered: {value}\"\n```\n### With seconds\nSet `withSeconds` prop to enable seconds input. Note that if this prop is used, the value is not updated until all\ninputs are filled – it is not possible to enter only hours and minutes.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    gap=50,\n    children=[\n        dmc.TimePicker(label=\"Enter a time\", withSeconds=True, id=\"timepicker-seconds\"),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"out-timepicker-seconds\")\n    ],\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"out-timepicker-seconds\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"timepicker-seconds\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update(value):\n    return f\"You entered: {value}\"\n```\n### 12-hour format\nSet `format=\"12h\"` to use 12-hour format. Note that `value` is updated only when all inputs are filled including am/pm input.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    gap=50,\n    children=[\n        dmc.TimePicker(label=\"Enter a time\", format=\"12h\", id=\"timepicker-12\"),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"out-timepicker-12\")\n    ],\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"out-timepicker-12\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"timepicker-12\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update(value):\n    return f\"You entered: {value}\"\n```\n### Change am/pm labels\nTo change am/pm labels use `amPmLabels` prop. Example of changing labels to Hindi:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent =  dmc.TimePicker(\n    label=\"Enter a time\",\n    format=\"12h\",\n    amPmLabels={\"am\": 'पूर्वाह्न', \"pm\": 'अपराह्न'}\n)\n```\n### Min and max values\nSet `min` and `max` props to limit available time range:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent =  dmc.TimePicker(\n    label=\"Enter a time between 10:00 and 18:30\",\n    min=\"10:00\",\n    max=\"18:30\"\n)\n```\n### With dropdown\nSet `withDropdown` prop to display the dropdown with hours, minutes, seconds and am/pm selects. By default,\nthe dropdown is visible when one of the inputs is focused.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    gap=50,\n    mb=60,\n    children=[\n        dmc.TimePicker(\n            label=\"Enter time (24h format)\",\n            withSeconds=True,\n            withDropdown=True\n        ),\n        dmc.TimePicker(\n            label=\"Enter time (12h format)\",\n            withSeconds=True,\n            withDropdown=True,\n            format=\"12h\"\n        ),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Hours/minutes/seconds step\nUse `hoursStep`, `minutesStep` and `secondsStep` props to control step for each input. These props are used to control\nvalue by which the input is incremented or decremented when up/down arrow keys are pressed and to generate corresponding\nvalues range in the dropdown.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent =  dmc.TimePicker(\n    label=\"Enter a time\",\n    withSeconds=True,\n    withDropdown=True,\n    hoursStep=1,\n    minutesStep=5,\n    secondsStep=10\n)\n```\n### Time presets\nYou can define time presets with `presets` prop. Presets are displayed in the dropdown and can be selected by clicking\non them. Time values for presets should be in hh:mm:ss or hh:mm 24-hour time format. Presets display value is generated\nbased on `format`, `amPmLabels` and `withSeconds` props.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.TimePicker(\n    label=\"Enter a time\",\n    format=\"12h\",\n    withDropdown=True,\n    presets=['11:30', '15:45', '18:00', '20:15', '22:30']\n)\n```\n### Time presets groups\nTo group presets use a list of dictionaries with label and values keys:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.TimePicker(\n    label=\"Enter a time\",\n    withDropdown=True,\n    maxDropdownContentHeight=300,\n    presets = [\n        {\"label\": 'Morning', \"values\": ['06:00:00', '08:00:00', '10:00:00']},\n        {\"label\": 'Afternoon', \"values\": ['12:00:00', '14:00:00', '16:00:00']},\n        {\"label\": 'Evening', \"values\": ['18:00:00', '20:00:00', '22:00:00']},\n    ],\n    mb=120,\n)\n```\n### Time presets range\nUse the `timeRangePresets` prop to generate a range of times. It accepts a dictionary with `startTime`,\n`endTime`, and `interval` keys, where all values are strings in `hh:mm:ss` format. This overrides any values provided \ndirectly in the `presets` prop.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.TimePicker(\n    label=\"Enter a time\",\n    format=\"12h\",\n    withDropdown=True,\n    timeRangePresets={\"startTime\": \"06:00:00\", \"endTime\": \"18:00:00\", \"interval\": \"01:30:00\"}\n)\n```\n### Dropdown position\nBy default, the dropdown is displayed below the input if there is enough space; otherwise it is displayed above the \ninput. You can change this behavior by setting `position` and `middlewares` props, which are passed down to the\nunderlying `Popover` component.\n\nExample of dropdown that is always displayed above the input:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.TimePicker(\n    label=\"Enter a time\",\n    withDropdown=True,\n    popoverProps={\n        \"position\": 'top-start',\n        \"middlewares\": {\"flip\": False, \"shift\": False },\n      }\n)\n```\n### Dropdown width\nTo change dropdown width, set `width` prop in `popoverProps`. By default, dropdown width is adjusted to fit all content.\nExample of dropdown width set to the input width:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.TimePicker(\n    label=\"Enter a time\",\n    withDropdown=True,\n    withSeconds=True,\n    format=\"12h\",\n    popoverProps={\"width\": \"target\"}\n)\n```\n### Clearable\nSet `clearable` prop to display a clear button in the right section of the input. The clear button is visible when at\nleast one of the fields has value.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.TimePicker(\n    label=\"Enter a time\",\n    withDropdown=True,\n    withSeconds=True,\n    clearable=True,\n    value=\"12:30:00\"\n)\n```\n### Disabled\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.TimePicker(\n    label=\"Enter a time\",\n    disabled=True\n)\n```\n### Read only\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.TimePicker(\n    label=\"Enter a time\",\n    readOnly=True,\n    value=\"12:30:00\"\n)\n```\n### Input Props\n\nTimeInput supports all props from Input and InputWrapper components such as `radius`, `size`, `required`, etc.\n\n### Invalid State And Error\n\nYou can display an error with a red border and add an error message.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    children=[\n        dmc.TimePicker(label=\"Enter Time:\", w=100, error=True),\n        dmc.TimePicker(\n            label=\"Enter Time:\",\n            w=150,\n            error=\"Enter a valid time\",\n            withSeconds=True,\n        ),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Accessibility\n\nSet aria labels for hours, minutes, seconds and am/pm inputs and clear button with corresponding props:\n```python\n    dmc.TimePicker(\n      hoursInputLabel=\"Hours\",\n      minutesInputLabel=\"Minutes\",\n      secondsInputLabel=\"Seconds\",\n      amPmInputLabel=\"AM/PM\",\n      clearButtonProps={{ 'aria-label': 'Clear time' }}\n    \n  )\n```\n\n### Keyboard Interactions\n\n\n| Key          | Description                              |\n| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |\n| `ArrowDown`  | Decrements current value by step         |\n| `ArrowUp`    | Increments current value by step         |\n| `Home`       | Sets current value to min possible value |\n| `End`        | Sets current value to max possible value |\n| `Backspace`  | Clears current value                     |\n| `ArrowRight` | Moves focus to the next input            |\n| `ArrowLeft`  | Moves focus to the previous input        |\n\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n     \n\n\n#### TimePicker Selectors\n\n| Selector          | Static selector                         | Description                                                       |\n| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| wrapper           | `.mantine-TimePicker-wrapper`           | Root element of the Input                                         |\n| input             | `.mantine-TimePicker-input`             | Input element                                                     |\n| section           | `.mantine-TimePicker-section`           | Left and right sections                                           |\n| root              | `.mantine-TimePicker-root`              | Root element                                                      |\n| label             | `.mantine-TimePicker-label`             | Label element                                                     |\n| required          | `.mantine-TimePicker-required`          | Required asterisk element, rendered inside label                  |\n| description       | `.mantine-TimePicker-description`       | Description element                                               |\n| error             | `.mantine-TimePicker-error`             | Error element                                                     |\n| control           | `.mantine-TimePicker-control`           | Button in the dropdown used to select hours/minutes/seconds/am-pm |\n| controlsList      | `.mantine-TimePicker-controlsList`      | List of buttons for hours/minutes/seconds/am-pm                   |\n| controlsListGroup | `.mantine-TimePicker-controlsListGroup` | Group of `controlsList`s                                          |\n| dropdown          | `.mantine-TimePicker-dropdown`          | Popover dropdown                                                  |\n| fieldsRoot        | `.mantine-TimePicker-fieldsRoot`        | Wrapper for all `fieldsGroup` elements                            |\n| fieldsGroup       | `.mantine-TimePicker-fieldsGroup`       | Wrapper for hours/minutes/seconds/am-pm fields                    |\n| field             | `.mantine-TimePicker-field`             | Hours/minutes/seconds/am-pm input field                           |\n| presetControl     | `.mantine-TimePicker-presetControl`     | Time preset button                                                |\n| presetsGroup      | `.mantine-TimePicker-presetsGroup`      | Wraps preset controls and label                                   |\n| presetsGroupLabel | `.mantine-TimePicker-presetsGroupLabel` | Label of the preset group                                         |\n| presetsRoot       | `.mantine-TimePicker-presetsRoot`       | Wrapper for all presets content                                   |\n| scrollarea        | `.mantine-TimePicker-scrollarea`        | Scroll area in the dropdown                                       |\n\n\n#### TimePicker CSS Variables\n\n| Selector | Variable              | Description                             |\n| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| dropdown | `--control-font-size` | Controls font-size of dropdown controls |\n\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### TimePicker\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- amPmInputLabel (string; optional):\n    `aria-label` of am/pm input.\n\n- amPmLabels (dict; optional):\n    Labels used for am/pm values, `{ am: 'AM', pm: 'PM' }` by default.\n\n    `amPmLabels` is a dict with keys:\n\n- amPmSelectProps (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Props passed down to am/pm select.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

    "content": "\n\n## YearPickerInput  \nYear, multiple years and years range picker input  \nCategory: Date Pickers  \n\n### Simple Example\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.YearPickerInput(\n    label=\"Pick date\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick date\",\n)\n```\n### Multiple dates\n\nSet type=\"multiple\" to allow user to pick multiple months.  Note that `value` is a list.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.YearPickerInput(\n    type=\"multiple\",\n    label=\"Pick multiple dates\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick dates\",\n)\n```\n### Dates range\n\nSet type=\"range\" to allow user to pick dates range. Note that `value` is a list.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.YearPickerInput(\n    type=\"range\",\n    label=\"Pick dates range\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick dates range\",\n)\n```\n### Open picker in modal\n\nBy default, YearPickerInput is rendered inside Popover. You can change that to Modal by setting dropdownType=\"modal\"\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.YearPickerInput(\n    dropdownType=\"modal\",\n    label=\"Pick date (picker in modal)\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick date\",\n)\n```\n### Number of columns\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.YearPickerInput(\n    label=\"Pick date\", placeholder=\"Pick date\", numberOfColumns=2\n)\n```\n### Value format\n\nUse `valueFormat` property to change the format of the date displayed in the date input field.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.YearPickerInput(\n    valueFormat=\"YY\",\n    type=\"multiple\",\n    label=\"Pick month (Value Formatter)\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick month\",\n)\n```\nUse `valueFormat` prop to change [dayjs format](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) of value label.\n\n### Clearable\n\nSet `clearable=True` prop to display clear button in the right section. Note that if you set `rightSection` prop, clear button will not be displayed.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.YearPickerInput(\n    clearable=True,\n    value=datetime.now(),\n    label=\"Pick date (clearable)\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick Date\",\n)\n```\n### With Icon\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.YearPickerInput(\n    leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"fa:calendar\"),\n    leftSectionPointerEvents=\"none\",\n    label=\"Pick date\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick date\",\n)\n```\n### Min and Max date\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.YearPickerInput(\n    minDate=datetime(2021, 1, 1),\n    maxDate=datetime(2028, 1, 1),\n    value=datetime(2021, 1, 1),\n    placeholder=\"Date input\",\n    label=\"Select valid date\",\n    w=250,\n)\n```\n### CSS Extensions\n\nAs of DMC 1.2.0, Date component styles are bundled automatically, so you no longer need to include a separate CSS file.\nIf you're using an older version of DMC, refer to the [migration guide](/migration) for instructions on including optional stylesheets.\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n#### YearPickerInput selectors\n\n| Selector                   | Static selector                                      | Description                                                           |\n| ---------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `wrapper`                  | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-wrapper`                   | Root element of the Input                                              |\n| `input`                    | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-input`                     | Input element                                                         |\n| `section`                  | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-section`                   | Left and right sections                                                |\n| `root`                     | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-root`                      | Root element                                                          |\n| `label`                    | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-label`                     | Label element                                                         |\n| `required`                 | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-required`                  | Required asterisk element, rendered inside label                       |\n| `description`              | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-description`               | Description element                                                    |\n| `error`                    | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-error`                     | Error element                                                         |\n| `calendarHeader`           | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-calendarHeader`            | Calendar header root element                                           |\n| `calendarHeaderControl`     | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-calendarHeaderControl`     | Previous/next calendar header controls                                 |\n| `calendarHeaderControlIcon` | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-calendarHeaderControlIcon` | Icon of previous/next calendar header controls                         |\n| `calendarHeaderLevel`       | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-calendarHeaderLevel`       | Level control (changes levels when clicked, month -> year -> decade)   |\n| `levelsGroup`              | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-levelsGroup`               | Group of decades levels                                                |\n| `yearsList`                | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-yearsList`                 | Years list table element                                               |\n| `yearsListRow`             | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-yearsListRow`              | Years list row element                                                 |\n| `yearsListCell`            | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-yearsListCell`             | Years list cell element                                                |\n| `yearsListControl`         | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-yearsListControl`          | Button used to pick months and years                                   |\n| `placeholder`              | `.mantine-YearPickerInput-placeholder`               | Placeholder element                                                    |\n\n#### YearPickerInput data attributes\n\n| Selector              | Attribute      | Condition                           | Value                              |\n| --------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\n| `calendarHeaderControl`| `data-direction`| –                                   | \"previous\" or \"next\" depending on the control type |\n| `calendarHeaderControl`| `data-disabled`| Control is disabled for any reason  | –                                  |\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### YearPickerInput\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- allowDeselect (boolean; optional):\n    Determines whether user can deselect the date by clicking on\n    selected item, applicable only when type=\"default\".\n\n- allowSingleDateInRange (boolean; optional):\n    Determines whether single year can be selected as range,\n    applicable only when type=\"range\".\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- ariaLabels (dict; optional):\n    aria-label attributes for controls on different levels.\n\n    `ariaLabels` is a dict with keys:\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

You made a mistake and there is no going back!\"\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    children=[\n        dmc.Alert(message, title=\"Primary\", color=\"blue\"),\n        dmc.Alert(message, title=\"Secondary\", color=\"gray\"),\n        dmc.Alert(message, title=\"Success!\", color=\"green\"),\n        dmc.Alert(message, title=\"Warning!\", color=\"yellow\"),\n        dmc.Alert(message, title=\"Danger!\", color=\"red\"),\n        dmc.Alert(message, title=\"Info\", color=\"violet\"),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Dismissible Alerts\n\nThe alerts can be closed either programmatically by toggling the `hide` property or by clicking on the close button on the alert if enabled with `withCloseButton=True`.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, Output, Input, State, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Alert(\n            \"Something terrible happened! You made a mistake and there is no going back, your data was lost forever! \",\n            title=\"Bummer!\",\n            id=\"alert-dismiss\",\n            color=\"red\",\n            withCloseButton=True,\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\"Toggle alert\", id=\"alert-button\", mt=20),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"alert-dismiss\", \"hide\"),\n    Input(\"alert-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    State(\"alert-dismiss\", \"hide\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True,\n)\ndef alert(n_clicks, hide):\n    return not hide\n```\n### Automatic Dismissal\n\nThe alerts can also be timed out using the `duration` prop which accepts time in milliseconds.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, Output, Input, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Alert(\n            \"This alert will dismiss itself after 3 seconds! \",\n            title=\"Auto Dismissing Alert!\",\n            id=\"alert-auto\",\n            color=\"violet\",\n            duration=3000,\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\"Show alert\", id=\"alert-auto-button\", mt=20),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"alert-auto\", \"hide\"),\n    Input(\"alert-auto-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True,\n)\ndef alert_auto(n_clicks):\n    return False\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

    "content": "\n\n## Loader  \nUse Loader component to show loading state to the user.  \nCategory: Feedback  \n\n### Introduction\n\n### Simple Usage\nLoader component supports 3 types of loaders: `oval`, `bars` and `dots` by default. All loaders are animated with CSS for better performance.\n\nBy default, Loader will be rendered with theme.primaryColor. A Loader can be customized with `color`, `size`, and\n`type` props.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Loader(color=\"red\", size=\"md\", type=\"oval\")\n```\n### Button Example\nIn this example, the loader is shown while the callback is running.   Note that the button is disabled automatically when `loading=True`\nSee more examples in the Button section.\n\nThis examples uses the [running](https://dash.plotly.com/advanced-callbacks#updating-component-properties-when-a-callback-is-running)\nargument in a callback and requires dash>=2.16.\n\n\n```python\nimport time\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, Input, Output, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div([\n    dmc.Button(\"Compute\", id=\"load-btn\", loaderProps={\"type\": \"dots\"} ),\n    dmc.Text(id=\"load-output\"),\n])\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"load-output\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"load-btn\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    running=[(Output(\"load-btn\", \"loading\"), True, False)],\n)\ndef long_compute(n):\n    time.sleep(2)\n    return \"Done \" + str(time.time())\n```\n### children prop\n\n`Loader` supports children prop. If you pass anything to children, it will be rendered instead of the loader. This is \nuseful when you want to control Loader representation in components that use loaderProps, for example `Button` or `LoadingOverlay`.\n\nSee an example in the [Loading Overlay](/components/loadingoverlay) section,\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n#### Loader selectors\n\n| Name        | Static selector      | Description                                      |\n|:------------|:---------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|\n| root        | .mantine-Loader-root | Root element                                     |\n\n\n#### Loader CSS Variables\n\n| Selector | Variable         | Description                                                         |\n|----------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| root     | --loader-size    | Controls loader size (usually width and height, in some cases only width) |\n|          | --loader-color   | Controls loader color                                              |\n\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### Loader\n\n- children (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):\n    Overrides default loader with given content.\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

A random ID is generated if not provided.\n* `action` – one of `\"show\"`, or `\"update\"`\n  \n    * `\"show\"` – adds a new notification or queues it if the limit is reached\n    * `\"update\"` – updates a notification previously shown or queued\n* `message` – required notification body \n* `position` – notification position. If not provided, the default from `NotificationContainer` is used.\n* `withBorder` – whether the notification should have a border\n* `withCloseButton` – whether the close button is visible\n* `autoClose` – timeout in milliseconds to automatically close the notification. Set to `False` to disable.\n* `color` -Controls notification line or icon color, key of `theme.colors` or any valid CSS color, `theme.primaryColor` by default.\n* `icon` - Notification icon, replaces color line.\n* `title` - Notification title, displayed before body.\n* `radius` -  Key of `theme.radius` or any valid CSS value to set `border-radius`, `theme.defaultRadius` by default\n*  `loading`- Replaces colored line or icon with Loader component.\n*  `className`, `style`, `loading`\n\n\n### Notification Position\nYou can set position per-notification in the `sendNotifications` dictionary. \n```python\nsendNotifications = [\n  {\n    \"action\": \"show\",\n    \"id\": \"my-id\",\n    \"message\": \"Positioned top-left\",\n    \"position\": \"top-left\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nValid position values:\n\n* `\"top-left\"`\n* `\"top-right\"`\n* `\"top-center\"`\n* `\"bottom-left\"`\n* `\"bottom-right\"`\n* `\"bottom-center\"`\n\n```python\nimport dash\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Output, Input\n\npositions = ['top-left', 'top-right', 'bottom-left', 'bottom-right', 'top-center', 'bottom-center']\n\ncomponent =  dmc.RadioGroup(\n    children=dmc.Group([dmc.Radio(p, value=p) for p in positions], my=10),\n    label=\"Select Notification position\",\n    value=None,\n    id=\"notification-position\"\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"notification-container\", \"sendNotifications\", allow_duplicate=True),\n    Input(\"notification-position\", \"value\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True,\n)\ndef notify(value):\n    if value:\n        return [dict(\n            title=f\"Notification {value}\",\n            autoClose=True,\n            action=\"show\",\n            message=\"Hello World\",\n            color=\"red\",\n            position=value,\n        )]\n    return dash.no_update\n```\nYou can also set a default position in the `NotificationContainer`. \n\n```python\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider([\n    dmc.NotificationContainer(position=\"top-right\", id=\"notification-container\"),\n])\n```\n\n### Limit and queue\n\nTo limit the number of notifications displayed at once, use the `limit` prop:\n\n```python\ndmc.NotificationContainer(limit=5)\n```\n\nNotifications beyond the limit are added to the queue and shown when others are dismissed.\n\n```python\nfrom dash import Output, Input, callback, ctx, no_update\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Button(\"Show 10 notifications\", id=\"notify-btn\", n_clicks=0),\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"notification-container\", \"sendNotifications\", allow_duplicate=True),\n    Input(\"notify-btn\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True\n)\ndef queue_notifications(n):\n    if n > 0:\n        return [\n            {\n                \"action\": \"show\",\n                \"title\": f\"Notification {i + 1}\",\n                \"message\": \"Most notifications are added to queue\",\n                \"autoClose\": 3000,\n                \"withCloseButton\": True,\n            }\n            for i in range(10)\n        ]\n    return no_update\n```\n### Hide Notifications\n\nUse the `hideNotifications` prop to remove notifications by `id` from the state and queue.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, html, ctx, callback, no_update\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.NotificationContainer(id=\"notification-container\"),\n        dmc.Group(\n            [\n                dmc.Button(\n                    \"Show\",\n                    id=\"notifications-show\",\n                    n_clicks=0\n                ),\n                dmc.Button(\n                    \"Hide\",\n                    id=\"notifications-hide\",\n                    n_clicks=0\n                ),\n            ],\n        ),\n    ],\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"notification-container\", \"sendNotifications\", allow_duplicate=True),\n    Output(\"notification-container\", \"hideNotifications\"),\n    Input(\"notifications-show\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    Input(\"notifications-hide\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True,\n)\ndef notify(n1, n2):\n    button_id = ctx.triggered_id\n    if n1 > 0:\n        if \"show\" in button_id:\n            return [dict(\n                id=\"show-hide\",\n                action=\"show\",\n                message=\"Notification Message\",\n                color=\"Red\",\n                autoClose=False,\n            )], no_update\n    if n2 > 0:\n        if \"hide\" in button_id:\n            return no_update, [\"show-hide\"]\n    return no_update\n```\n### clean and cleanQueue\n\nUse `cleanQueue` to remove all queued notifications, and `clean` to remove all notifications from both state and queue.\n\n```python\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output, no_update\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    justify=\"center\",\n    children=[\n        dmc.Button(\"Show 10 notifications\", id=\"show-btn\", n_clicks=0),\n        dmc.Button(\"Clean queue\", id=\"clean-queue-btn\", variant=\"default\", n_clicks=0),\n        dmc.Button(\"Clean all\", id=\"clean-all-btn\", variant=\"outline\", color=\"red\", n_clicks=0),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"notification-container\", \"sendNotifications\", allow_duplicate=True),\n    Input(\"show-btn\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True\n)\ndef show_notifications(n):\n    return [\n        {\n            \"action\":

range(10)\n    ]\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"notification-container\", \"cleanQueue\"),\n    Input(\"clean-queue-btn\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True\n)\ndef clean_queue(n):\n    if n > 0:\n        return True\n    return no_update\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"notification-container\", \"clean\"),\n    Input(\"clean-all-btn\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True\n)\ndef clean_all(n):\n    if n > 0:\n        return True\n    return no_update\n```\n### autoClose\n\n```python\nfrom dash import Input, Output, callback, no_update\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    justify=\"center\",\n    children=[\n        dmc.Button(\"Closes in 4 seconds\", id=\"default-close-btn\", n_clicks=0),\n

}]\n    return no_update\n```\n### Use in Clientside Callbacks\n\n`NotificationContainer` exposes the underlying Mantine notifications API globally in JavaScript. You can access this\nin clientside callbacks using:\n\n```js\ndash_mantine_components.appNotifications\n```\n\nYou can use the the full [Mantine notifications API](https://mantine.dev/x/notifications/):\n\n- Show: `appNotifications.api.show({...})`\n\n- Update: `appNotifications.api.update({...})`\n\n- Hide: `appNotifications.api.hide(\"id\")`\n\n- Clean: `appNotifications.api.clean()`\n\n- Clean queue: `appNotifications.api.cleanQueue()`\n\n- View state: `appNotifications.store`\n\n\nThe example below demonstrates how to:\n\n* Show a notification from a clientside callback\n* Display the notification store in a `html.Pre` component\n* Clean all notifications on the client\n\n```python\nfrom dash import Dash, html, clientside_callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncomponent = html.Div([\n        dmc.Group([\n            dmc.Button(\"Show Notification\", id=\"api-show\"),\n            dmc.Button(\"Clean\", id=\"api-clean\", variant=\"outline\", color=\"red\"),\n            dmc.Button(\"View Store\", id=\"fetch-notification-store\", variant=\"default\"),\n        ]),\n        html.Pre(id=\"notification-store\", style={\"whiteSpace\": \"pre-wrap\", \"padding\": \"10px\"}),\n\n])\n\nclientside_callback(\n    \"\"\"(n) => {\n        if (n > 0) {\n            dash_mantine_components.appNotifications.api.show({\n                title: \"Client-side Notification\",\n                message: \"Triggered from clientside callback\",\n                color: \"blue\",\n                autoClose: false\n            });\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\"\"\",\n    Output(\"api-show\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    Input(\"api-show\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True\n)\n\nclientside_callback(\n    \"\"\"() => {\n        dash_mantine_components.appNotifications.api.clean()\n        return null;\n    }\"\"\",\n    Output(\"api-clean\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    Input(\"api-clean\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True\n)\n\nclientside_callback(\n    \"\"\"() => {\n        return JSON.stringify(dash_mantine_components.appNotifications.store, null, 2)\n    }\"\"\",\n    Output(\"notification-store\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"fetch-notification-store\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True\n)\n```\n### Notifications in Multi Page apps\n\nIn multi-page apps, define `NotificationContainer` in `app.layout`—even if notifications are triggered from other pages.\n\nThis ensures the container is always mounted and available, preventing errors when navigating between pages while notifications are active.\n\n### CSS Extensions\n\n\nAs of DMC 1.2.0, Notification component styles are bundled automatically, so you no longer need to include a separate CSS file.\nIf you're using an older version of DMC, refer to the [migration guide](/migration) for instructions on including optional stylesheets.\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n\n\n#### Notification Selectors\n\n\n| Selector    | Static Selector                     | Description                                            |\n| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |\n| root        | `.mantine-Notification-root`        | Root element                                           |\n| loader      | `.mantine-Notification-loader`      | Loader component, displayed only when `loading` is set |\n| icon        | `.mantine-Notification-icon`        | Icon component, displayed only when `icon` is set      |\n| body        | `.mantine-Notification-body`        | Notification body, contains all other elements         |\n| title       | `.mantine-Notification-title`       | Title element, displayed only when `title` is set      |\n| description | `.mantine-Notification-description` | Description displayed below the title                  |\n| closeButton | `.mantine-Notification-closeButton` | Close button element                                   |\n\n\n\n#### Notification CSS Variables\n\n| Selector | Variable                | Description                                    |\n| -------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| root     | `--notification-radius` | Controls border-radius                         |\n| root     | `--notification-color`  | Controls icon color or notification line color |\n\n\n\n#### Notification Data Attributes\n\n| Selector    | Attribute          | Condition                |\n| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |\n| root        | `data-with-icon`   | `icon` prop is set       |\n| root        | `data-with-border` | `withBorder` prop is set |\n| description | `data-with-title`  | `title` prop is set      |\n\n\n\n\n#### Notifications Selectors\n| Selector      | Static Selector                         | Description                                      |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| `root`       | `.mantine-Notifications-root`      | Notifications container, contains all notifications |\n| `notification` | `.mantine-Notifications-notification` | Single notification |\n\n#### Notifications CSS Variables\n| Selector | Variable | Description |\n|----------|----------|-------------|\n| `root`   | `--notifications-container-width` | Controls notifications container max-width |\n| `root`   | `--notifications-z-index` | Controls notifications container z-index |\n\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### NotificationContainer\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

When the `fixed=True` prop is set, it takes 100%\nwidth and height of the viewport instead.\n\nSet `color` and `backgroundOpacity` props to change `Overlay` background-color.\nNote that `backgroundOpacity` prop does not change CSS opacity property, it changes background-color. For example, \nif you set `color=\"#000\"` and `backgroundOpacity={0.85}` background-color will be `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.85)`:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Dash, Input, Output, callback, html\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n        dmc.AspectRatio(\n            ratio=16/9,\n            maw=400,\n            mx=\"auto\",\n            pos=\"relative\",\n            children=[\n                html.Img(\n                    src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/images/bg-1.png\",\n                    alt=\"Demo\",\n                ),\n                dmc.Overlay(\n                    id=\"overlay-usage\",\n                    color=\"#000\",\n                    backgroundOpacity=0.85,\n                    style={\"display\": \"block\"}  # Initially visible\n                )\n            ]\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Toggle overlay\",\n            id=\"overlay-toggle-button\",\n            mx=\"auto\",\n            mt=\"lg\",\n            n_clicks=0\n        )\n    ])\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"overlay-usage\", \"style\"),\n    Input(\"overlay-toggle-button\", \"n_clicks\")\n)\ndef toggle_overlay(n_clicks):\n    if n_clicks %2 == 0:\n        return {\"display\": \"block\"}\n    return {\"display\": \"none\"}\n```\n### Gradient\nSet `gradient` prop to use `background-image` instead of `background-color`.

You can change bar color by passing `color`\nprop (by default theme.primaryColor will be used).\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Progress(value=26, color=\"pink\")\n```\n### Size\n\n`size` controls progress bar height. Progress has predefined sizes: xs, sm, etc.\nAlternatively, you can use a number to set height in px.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Progress(size=\"sm\")\n\ndmc.Progress(size=20)\n```\n\n### Radius\n\nRadius controls border-radius of body and filled part.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Progress(radius=\"lg\")\n\ndmc.Progress(radius=10)\n```\n\n### Multiple sections\n\nMultiple sections can be displayed instead of just one single bar.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.ProgressRoot(\n    [\n        dmc.ProgressSection(dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Documents\"), value=33, color=\"cyan\"),\n        dmc.ProgressSection(dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Photos\"), value=28, color=\"pink\"),\n        dmc.ProgressSection(dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Others\"), value=15, color=\"orange\"),\n    ],\n    size=\"xl\",\n)\n```\n### Vertical orientation\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group([\n    dmc.Progress(value=80, orientation=\"vertical\", h=200),\n\n    dmc.Progress(\n        value=60,\n        color=\"orange\",\n        size=\"xl\",\n        orientation=\"vertical\",\n        h=200,\n        animated=True\n    ),\n\n    dmc.ProgressRoot(\n        size=\"xl\",\n        autoContrast=True,\n        orientation=\"vertical\",\n        h=200,\n        children=[\n            dmc.ProgressSection(\n                value=40,\n                color=\"lime.4\",\n                children=dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Documents\")\n            ),\n            dmc.ProgressSection(\n                value=20,\n                color=\"yellow.4\",\n                children=dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Apps\")\n            ),\n            dmc.ProgressSection(\n                value=20,\n                color=\"cyan.7\",\n                children=dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Other\")\n            )\n        ]\n    )\n])\n```\n### With Tooltip\n\nUse the [Tooltip target](/components/tooltip#target) prop rather than using `ProgressSection` as Tooltip children.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box(\n    [\n        dmc.ProgressRoot(\n            [\n                dmc.ProgressSection(\n                    dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Documents\"),\n                    value=33,\n                    color=\"cyan\",\n                    id=\"progress-section1\",\n                ),\n                dmc.ProgressSection(\n                    dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Photos\"),\n                    value=28,\n                    color=\"pink\",\n                    id=\"progress-section2\",\n                ),\n                dmc.ProgressSection(\n                    dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Others\"),\n                    value=15,\n                    color=\"orange\",\n                    id=\"progress-section3\",\n                ),\n            ],\n            size=\"40\",\n        ),\n        dmc.Tooltip(\n            target=\"#progress-section1\",\n            label=\"Documents – 33Gb\",\n        ),\n        dmc.Tooltip(\n            target=\"#progress-section2\",\n            label=\"Photos – 28Gb\",\n        ),\n        dmc.Tooltip(\n            target=\"#progress-section3\",\n            label=\"Other – 15Gb\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### With FloatingTooltip\n\nWhen using `FloatingTooltips`  set `boxWrapperProps={'display': 'contents'}` for best results:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.ProgressRoot(\n    [\n        dmc.FloatingTooltip(\n            dmc.ProgressSection(\n                dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Documents\"),\n                value=33,\n                color=\"cyan\",\n            ),\n            label=\"Documents – 33Gb\",\n            boxWrapperProps={\"display\": \"contents\"},\n        ),\n        dmc.FloatingTooltip(\n            dmc.ProgressSection(\n                dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Photos\"),\n                value=28,\n                color=\"pink\",\n            ),\n            label=\"Photos – 28Gb\",\n            boxWrapperProps={\"display\": \"contents\"},\n        ),\n        dmc.FloatingTooltip(\n            dmc.ProgressSection(\n                dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Other\"),\n                value=25,\n                color=\"orange\",\n            ),\n            label=\"Other – 15Gb\",\n            boxWrapperProps={\"display\": \"contents\"},\n        ),\n    ],\n    size=40,\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

    "category": "Feedback",
    "content": "\n\n## Skeleton  \nUse Skeleton component to disable user interactions and indicate loading state.  \nCategory: Feedback  \n\n### Simple Usage\n\nUse `Skeleton` to create a placeholder for loading content. `Skeleton` support the following props:\n\n- `height` - height - any valid CSS value\n- `width` - width - any valid CSS value\n- `radius` - key of `theme.radius` or any valid CSS value to set border-radius\n- `circle` - if true, width, height and border-radius will equal to value specified in `height` prop\n- `animate` - true by default, controls animation\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box(\n    [\n        dmc.Skeleton(height=50,  circle=True, mb=\"xl\"),\n        dmc.Skeleton(height=8, radius=\"xl\"),\n        dmc.Skeleton(height=8, my=6),\n        dmc.Skeleton(height=8, w=\"70%\", radius=\"xl\"),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Display Skeleton while loading\n\nThe `Seleton` will be visible while the children components are being updated by a Dash callback.\n\n```python\nimport time\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, Output, Input, callback\n\nfrom lib.utils import create_graph\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Skeleton(\n            visible=False,\n            children=html.Div(id=\"skeleton-graph-container\", children=create_graph()),\n            mb=10,\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\"Click Me!\", id=\"graph-skeleton-button\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"skeleton-graph-container\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"graph-skeleton-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\ndef update_graph(n_clicks):\n    time.sleep(2)\n    return create_graph()\n```\n### Use with dcc.Loading\n\nFor greater control over when the `Skeleton` is displayed and for how long, use the `dcc.Loading` component from\n`dash-core-components`. Set the `Skeleton` in the `custom_spinner` prop and configure options such as:  \n\n- `delay_show`: Specifies the wait time before displaying the `Skeleton`. This helps prevent flickering for fast-loading content.  \n- `delay_hide`: Defines how long the `Skeleton` remains visible after loading completes, creating a smoother transition between the placeholder and final content.  \n- `target_components`: Determines which components trigger the `Skeleton` display. This allows fine-grained control,\nmaking the loading effect triggered only by specific components rather than automatically being triggered by any of the children.\n\nRefer to the [Dash Documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components/loading) for more details.\n\nHere is an example of `delay_hide` prop in `dcc.Loading` to prevent the `Skeleton` from showing for a very short time.\n\n```python\nimport time\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import  Input, Output,  html, callback, dcc\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dcc.Loading(\n            children=html.Div([\n                dmc.Text(\"Initial data\", id=\"dccloading-div\"),\n                dmc.Text(\"The data only takes 200ms to update, but `delay_hide` is set to 1000ms to prevent flashing.\")\n            ]),\n            delay_hide=1000,\n            custom_spinner = dmc.Skeleton(\n                visible=True,\n                h=\"100%\"\n            ),\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\"Update!\", id=\"dccloading-button\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"dccloading-div\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"dccloading-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True\n)\ndef update_graph(n):\n    time.sleep(.2)\n    return f\"Data updated {n} times\"\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

You can reference colors from theme.colors or use any valid CSS color:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Checkbox(\n    checked=True,\n    color=\"lime.4\",\n    iconColor=\"dark.8\",\n    size=\"md\",\n    label=\"Bright lime checkbox\"\n)\n```\n### Different Colors\n\nSet checkbox color using the `color` prop.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    children=[\n        dmc.Checkbox(label=\"I agree to sell my privacy\", color=\"green\", checked=True),\n        dmc.Checkbox(label=\"I agree to sell my privacy\", color=\"blue\", checked=True),\n        dmc.Checkbox(label=\"I agree to sell my privacy\", color=\"red\", checked=True),\n        dmc.Checkbox(label=\"I agree to sell my privacy\", color=\"orange\", checked=True),\n        dmc.Checkbox(label=\"I agree to sell my privacy\", color=\"pink\", checked=True),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Different Sizes\n\nChoose from one of the following sizes: xs, sm, md, lg, xl.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    children=[\n        dmc.Checkbox(label=\"I agree to sell my privacy\", size=\"xs\", checked=True),\n        dmc.Checkbox(label=\"I agree to sell my privacy\", size=\"sm\", checked=True),\n        dmc.Checkbox(label=\"I agree to sell my privacy\", size=\"md\", checked=True),\n        dmc.Checkbox(label=\"I agree to sell my privacy\", size=\"lg\", checked=True),\n        dmc.Checkbox(label=\"I agree to sell my privacy\", size=\"xl\", checked=True),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Add custom sizes\nUsing the [Styles API](/styles-api), you can add any number of custom sizes with `data-size` attribute.  Defining the checkbox \nsizes in the [theme object](/theme-object) in the `MantineProvider` makes them available to all `Checkbox` components in the app.\n\n - [Live Demo on PyCafe](https://py.cafe/dash.mantine.components/checkbox-custom-sizes-demo)  \n\n```python\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n    dmc.Checkbox(\n        label=\"Extra small checkbox\",\n        size=\"xxs\",\n    ),\n    dmc.Checkbox(\n        label=\"Extra extra large checkbox\",\n        size=\"xxl\",\n        mt=\"md\"\n    ),\n])\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n   children=component,\n    theme={\n        \"components\": {\n            \"Checkbox\": {\"classNames\": {\n                \"root\": \"checkbox-add-custom-sizes-root\",\n                \"label\": \"checkbox-add-custom-sizes-label\"}\n            }\n        }\n    }\n)\n```\nDefine the classes in a `.css` file in `/assets` folder\n\n```css\n.checkbox-add-custom-sizes-root {\n  --checkbox-size-xxl: 42px;\n  --checkbox-size-xxs: 14px;\n\n  &[data-size='xxl'] {\n    .checkbox-add-custom-sizes-label {\n      font-size: 22px;\n      line-height: 40px;\n    }\n  }\n\n  &[data-size='xxs'] {\n    .checkbox-add-custom-sizes-label {\n      font-size: 10px;\n      line-height: 14px;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n### Indeterminate state\n`Checkbox` supports indeterminate state. When `indeterminate=True` prop is set, `checked` prop is ignored (checkbox\nalways has checked styles)\n\n```python\nfrom dash import  html,  Input, Output,  callback, ALL, ctx\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ninitial_values = [\n    {\"label\": \"Receive email notifications\", \"checked\": False},\n    {\"label\": \"Receive sms notifications\", \"checked\": True},\n    {\"label\": \"Receive push notifications\", \"checked\": False},\n]\n\ncomponent = html.Div([\n    dmc.Checkbox(\n        id=\"all-notifications\",\n        label=\"Receive all notifications\",\n        checked=False,\n        indeterminate=False\n    ),\n    html.Div([\n        dmc.Checkbox(\n            id={\"type\": \"notification-item\", \"index\": i},\n            label=item[\"label\"],\n            checked=item[\"checked\"],\n            style={\"marginTop\": \"5px\", \"marginLeft\": \"33px\"}\n        )\n        for i, item in enumerate(initial_values)\n    ])\n])\n\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"all-notifications\", \"checked\"),\n    Output(\"all-notifications\", \"indeterminate\"),\n    Output({\"type\": \"notification-item\", \"index\": ALL}, \"checked\"),\n    Input(\"all-notifications\", \"checked\"),\n    Input({\"type\": \"notification-item\", \"index\": ALL}, \"checked\"),\n    prevent_initial_callback=True\n)\ndef update_main_checkbox(all_checked, checked_states):\n    # handle \"all\" checkbox\"\n    if ctx.triggered_id == 'all-notifications':\n        checked_states = [all_checked] * len(checked_states)\n\n    # handled individual check boxes\n    all_checked_states = all(checked_states)\n    indeterminate = any(checked_states) and not all_checked_states\n    return all_checked_states, indeterminate, checked_states\n```\n### Label with link\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Checkbox(\n    id=\"checkbox-simple\",\n    label=dmc.Text(\n        [\"I accept the \", dmc.Anchor(\"Terms and Conditions\", href=\"#\"), \".\"]\n    ),\n)\n```\n### Pointer cursor\nBy default, checkbox input and label have `cursor: default` (same as native `input[type='checkbox']`). To change cursor\nto pointer, set `cursorType` on `theme`:\n\n```python\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    theme = {\"cursorType\": \"pointer\"},\n    children={...}\n)\n```\n\n\n### Checkbox Group component\n\nUse CheckboxGroup component to create inputs with multiple checkbox elements and label, description, etc. You can use either\nthe dmc.Group or dmc.Stack to customize the orientation and spacing of checkbox elements.\n\nUse `value` property of the checkbox group in the callbacks.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, Output, Input, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.CheckboxGroup(\n            id=\"checkbox-group\",\n            label=\"Select your favorite library\",\n            description=\"This is anonymous\",\n            withAsterisk=True,\n            mb=10,\n            children=dmc.Group(\n                [\n                    dmc.Checkbox(label=\"Pandas\", value=\"pandas\"),\n                    dmc.Checkbox(label=\"Polars\", value=\"polars\"),\n                    dmc.Checkbox(label=\"Vaex\", value=\"vaex\"),\n                    dmc.Checkbox(label=\"Dask\", value=\"dask\"),\n                ],\n                mt=10,\n            ),\n            value=[\"pandas\", \"polars\"],\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"checkbox-group-output\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"checkbox-group-output\", \"children\"), Input(\"checkbox-group\", \"value\"))\ndef checkbox(value):\n    return \", \".join(value) if value else None\n```\n### CheckboxIndicator component\n\n`CheckboxIndicator` looks exactly the same as `Checkbox` component, but it does not have any semantic meaning, it's \njust a visual representation of checkbox state. You can use it in any place where you need to display checkbox state \nwithout any interaction related to the indicator. For example, it is useful in cards based on buttons, trees, etc.\n\n> Note that CheckboxIndicator cannot be focused or selected with keyboard. It is not accessible and should not be used as a replacement for Checkbox component.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group([\n    dmc.CheckboxIndicator(),\n    dmc.CheckboxIndicator(checked=True),\n    dmc.CheckboxIndicator(disabled=True),\n    dmc.CheckboxIndicator(disabled=True, checked=True)\n])\n```\n### CheckboxCard component\n`CheckboxCard` component can be used as a replacement for `Checkbox` to build custom cards/buttons/other things that\nwork as checkboxes. The root element of the component has `role=\"checkbox\"` attribute, it is accessible by default \nand supports the same keyboard interactions as `input[type=\"checkbox\"]`.\n\nNote - do not set the `checked` prop in the `CheckboxIndicator` component otherwise the `CheckboxIndicator` will not be updated.\n\n```python\nfrom dash import Input, Output, callback\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n        dmc.CheckboxCard(\n            id=\"checkbox-card\",\n            withBorder=True,\n            p=\"md\",\n            checked=True,\n            children=[\n                dmc.Center([\n                    dmc.CheckboxIndicator(),\n                    dmc.Text(\"CheckboxCard\", size=\"xl\", pl=\"sm\"),\n                ], inline=True),\n            ]\n        ),\n        dmc.Box(id=\"checkbox-card-out\"),\n    ], p=\"lg\")\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"checkbox-card-out\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"checkbox-card\", \"checked\")\n)\ndef update(checked):\n   return f\"Checked? {checked}\"\n```\n### CheckboxCard with CheckboxGroup\n\nYou can use `CheckboxCard` with `CheckboxGroup` the same way as `Checkbox` component.\n\nNote - do not set the `checked` prop in the `CheckboxIndicator` component otherwise the `CheckboxIndicator` will not be updated.\nThis example also shows how to add hover styles\n\n```python\n\nfrom dash import Input, Output, callback\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndef make_checkboxcard(label, description):\n    return dmc.CheckboxCard(\n        withBorder=True,\n        p=\"md\",\n        mt=\"md\",\n        className=\"checkboxcard-root\",\n        value=label,\n        children=[\n            dmc.Group([\n                dmc.CheckboxIndicator(),\n                dmc.Box([\n                    dmc.Text(label, lh=\"1.3\", fz=\"md\", fw=\"bold\" ),\n                    dmc.Text(description, size=\"sm\", c=\"dimmed\"),\n                ])\n            ], wrap=\"nowrap\", align=\"flex-start\"),\n        ]\n    )\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n    dmc.CheckboxGroup(\n        id=\"checkbox-card-group\",\n        label= \"CheckboxGroup label\",\n        value=[\"CheckboxCard 1\"],\n        description=\"This is a CheckboxGroup description\",\n        children=[\n            make_checkboxcard(f\"CheckboxCard {i}\", f\"Checkbox description {i}\")\n            for i in range(1, 5)\n        ]\n    ),\n    dmc.Box(id=\"checkbox-card-group-out\"),\n], p=\"lg\")\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"checkbox-card-group-out\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"checkbox-card-group\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update(checked):\n   return f\"Checked? {checked}\"\n```\n\n```css\n/* used for both CheckboxCard and RadioCard*/\n.checkboxcard-root {\n    position: relative;\n    padding: var(--mantine-spacing-md);\n    transition: border-color 150ms ease;\n\n    &[data-checked] {\n        border-color: var(--mantine-primary-color-filled);\n    }\n}\n\n.checkboxcard-root:hover {\n    background-color: light-dark(\n            var(--mantine-color-gray-0),\n            var(--mantine-color-dark-6)\n    );\n}\n```\n\n\n### Example: Customize with Styles API\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent =  dmc.Checkbox(\n    classNames={\"root\": \"dmc-api-demo-root\"},\n    label=\"Checkbox button\",\n    w=180\n)\n```\n\n```css\n\n.dmc-api-demo-root {\n  border: 1px solid light-dark(var(--mantine-color-gray-3), var(--mantine-color-dark-4));\n  padding: var(--mantine-spacing-xs) var(--mantine-spacing-sm);\n  border-radius: var(--mantine-radius-md);\n  font-weight: 500;\n  cursor: pointer;\n\n  &[data-checked] {\n    background-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-filled);\n    border-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-filled);\n    color: var(--mantine-color-white);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n   \n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n> Check the Mantine documentation to explore the available selectors.  The [interactive demo](https://mantine.dev/core/checkbox/#styles-api)\n> lets you hover over selectors to see which elements they correspond to.\n\n#### Checkbox Selectors\n\n| Selector       | Static selector              | Description                                             |\n|---------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| root          | .mantine-Checkbox-root       | Root element                                           |\n| input         | .mantine-Checkbox-input      | Input element (`input[type=\"checkbox\"]`)               |\n| icon          | .mantine-Checkbox-icon       | Checkbox icon, used to display checkmark and indeterminate state icon |\n| inner         | .mantine-Checkbox-inner      | Wrapper for icon and input                             |\n| body          | .mantine-Checkbox-body       | Input body, contains all other elements                |\n| labelWrapper  | .mantine-Checkbox-labelWrapper | Contains label, description, and error              |\n| label         | .mantine-Checkbox-label      | Label element                                          |\n| description   | .mantine-Checkbox-description | Description displayed below the label                 |\n| error         | .mantine-Checkbox-error      | Error message displayed below the label               |\n\n#### Checkbox CSS Variables\n\n| Selector | Variable              | Description                                |\n|----------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| root     | --checkbox-color     | Controls checked checkbox background-color |\n|          | --checkbox-radius    | Controls checkbox border-radius           |\n|          | --checkbox-size      | Controls checkbox width and height        |\n|          | --checkbox-icon-color | Controls checkbox icon color              |\n\n#### Checkbox Data Attributes\n\n| Selector | Attribute          | Condition                | Value                      |\n|----------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|\n| root     | data-checked      | `checked` prop is set   | –                          |\n| input    | data-error        | `error` prop is set     | –                          |\n| input    | data-indeterminate | `indeterminate` prop is set | –                     |\n| inner    | data-label-position | –                      | Value of `labelPosition` prop |\n\n#### CheckboxGroup Selectors\n\n| Selector    | Static selector               | Description                         |\n|------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| root       | .mantine-CheckboxGroup-root  | Root element                       |\n| label      | .mantine-CheckboxGroup-label | Label element                      |\n| required   | .mantine-CheckboxGroup-required | Required asterisk element, rendered inside label |\n| description | .mantine-CheckboxGroup-description | Description element                |\n| error      | .mantine-CheckboxGroup-error | Error element                      |\n\n#### CheckboxIndicator Selectors\n\n| Selector   | Static selector                     | Description   |\n|------------|------------------------------------|---------------|\n| indicator  | .mantine-CheckboxIndicator-indicator | Root element  |\n| icon       | .mantine-CheckboxIndicator-icon   | Checkbox icon |\n\n#### CheckboxIndicator CSS Variables\n\n| Selector   | Variable            | Description                                |\n|------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| indicator  | --checkbox-color   | Controls checked checkbox background-color |\n|            | --checkbox-radius  | Controls checkbox border-radius           |\n|            | --checkbox-size    | Controls checkbox width and height        |\n|            | --checkbox-icon-color | Controls checkbox icon color          |\n\n#### CheckboxIndicator Data Attributes\n\n| Selector   | Attribute     | Condition         |\n|------------|-------------|------------------|\n| indicator  | data-checked | `checked` prop is set |\n| indicator  | data-disabled | `disabled` prop is set |\n\n#### CheckboxCard Selectors\n\n| Selector | Static selector            | Description   |\n|----------|----------------------------|---------------|\n| card     | .mantine-CheckboxCard-card | Root element  |\n\n#### CheckboxCard CSS Variables\n\n| Selector | Variable      | Description                  |\n|----------|-------------|------------------------------|\n| card     | --card-radius | Controls card border-radius |\n\n#### CheckboxCard Data Attributes\n\n| Selector | Attribute       | Condition                  |\n|----------|----------------|----------------------------|\n| card     | data-checked    | `checked` prop is set      |\n| card     | data-with-border | `withBorder` prop is set  |\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### Checkbox\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.  See Styles\n    API docs.\n\n- autoContrast (boolean; optional):\n    Determines whether icon color with filled variant should depend on\n    `background-color`. If luminosity of the `color` prop is less than\n    `theme.luminosityThreshold`, then `theme.white` will be used for\n    text color, otherwise `theme.black`. Overrides\n    `theme.autoContrast`.\n\n- checked (boolean; optional):\n    State of check box.\n\n- className (string; optional):\n    Class added to the root element, if applicable.\n\n- classNames (dict; optional):\n    Adds custom CSS class names to inner elements of a component.  See\n    Styles API docs.\n\n- color (optional):\n    Key of `theme.colors` or any valid CSS color to set input\n    background color in checked state, `theme.primaryColor` by\n    default.\n\n- darkHidden (boolean; optional):\n    Determines whether component should be hidden in dark color scheme\n    with `display: none`.\n\n- data-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card data attributes.\n\n- description (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):\n    Description displayed below the label.\n\n- disabled (boolean; optional):\n    Whether component is disabled.\n\n- error (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):\n    Error message displayed below the label.\n\n- hiddenFrom (string; optional):\n    Breakpoint above which the component is hidden with `display:\n    none`.\n\n- icon (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):\n    Icon.\n\n- iconColor (optional):\n    Key of `theme.colors` or any valid CSS color to set icon color, by\n    default value depends on `theme.autoContrast`.\n\n- indeterminate (boolean; optional):\n    Indeterminate state of the checkbox. If set, `checked` prop is\n    ignored.\n\n- indeterminateIcon (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):\n    Indeterminate icon.\n\n- label (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):\n    Content of the `label` associated with the checkbox.\n\n- labelPosition (a value equal to: 'left', 'right'; optional):\n    Position of the label relative to the input, `'right'` by default.\n\n- lightHidden (boolean; optional):\n    Determines whether component should be hidden in light color\n    scheme with `display: none`.\n\n- loading_state (dict; optional):\n    Object that holds the loading state object coming from\n    dash-renderer. For use with dash<3.\n\n    `loading_state` is a dict with keys:\n\n- mod (string | dict | list of string | dicts; optional):\n    Element modifiers transformed into `data-` attributes. For\n    example: \"xl\" or {\"data-size\": \"xl\"}. Can also be a list of\n    strings or dicts for multiple modifiers. Falsy values are removed.\n\n- persisted_props (list of strings; optional):\n    Properties whose user interactions will persist after refreshing\n    the component or the page.

    "package": "dash_mantine_components",
    "category": "Inputs",
    "content": "\n\n## ColorInput  \nCapture color inputs from user.  \nCategory: Inputs  \n\n### Simple Example\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, html, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.ColorInput(id=\"color-input\", label=\"Your favorite color\", w=250),\n        dmc.Space(h=10),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"selected-color-input\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"selected-color-input\", \"children\"), Input(\"color-input\", \"value\"))\ndef pick(color):\n    return f\"You selected: {color}\"\n```\n### Formats\nComponent supports hex, hexa, rgb, rgba, hsl and hsla color formats. Slider to change opacity is displayed only for hexa, rgba and hsla formats.\n\n### Disable free input\nTo disable free input set disallowInput prop.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.ColorInput(\n    disallowInput=True, label=\"Your favorite color\", value=\"#e05e5e\", w=250\n)\n```\n### With swatches\nWith swatches\nYou can add any amount of predefined color swatches.  By default, there will be 10 swatches per row, you can change this with `swatchesPerRow` prop, like in ColorPicker component.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.ColorInput(\n    label=\"Your favorite color\",\n    value=\"#e05e5e\",\n    w=250,\n    format=\"hex\",\n    swatches=[\n        \"#25262b\",\n        \"#868e96\",\n        \"#fa5252\",\n        \"#e64980\",\n        \"#be4bdb\",\n        \"#7950f2\",\n        \"#4c6ef5\",\n        \"#228be6\",\n        \"#15aabf\",\n        \"#12b886\",\n        \"#40c057\",\n        \"#82c91e\",\n        \"#fab005\",\n        \"#fd7e14\",\n    ],\n)\n```\nIf you need to restrict color picking to certain colors – disable color picker and disallow free input:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncolors = dmc.DEFAULT_THEME[\"colors\"]\n\ncomponent = dmc.ColorInput(\n    label=\"Your favorite color\",\n    value=\"#40c057\",\n    disallowInput=True,\n    w=250,\n    withPicker=False,\n    swatches=colors[\"red\"] + colors[\"green\"],\n)\n```\n### Remove or replace preview\nBy default, color preview will be rendered on the left side of the input, you can remove it using `withPreview=False` or replace with an icon.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.ColorInput(\n            label=\"Without preview\",\n            withPreview=False,\n            value=\"#40c057\",\n            w=250,\n        ),\n        dmc.ColorInput(\n            label=\"With icon\",\n            leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"cil:paint\"),\n            withPreview=False,\n            w=250,\n            value=\"#40c057\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Eye dropper\nSet `withEyeDropper` prop to display eye dropper icon in the right section. This feature depends on `EyeDropper` API, the eye dropper will not be rendered if the API is not supported.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.ColorInput(\n    withEyeDropper=True, label=\"Pick any color from the page\", w=250\n)\n```\n### Input props\n\n### Accessibility\n#### Color picker focus\nColor picker is not focusable, users without mouse access can select color only by entering it into input manually. If you want to make component accessible do not disable free input.\n\n#### aria-label\nProvide `aria-labe`l in case you use component without label for screen reader support:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.ColorInput(value=\"#ffffff\")  # not ok, input is not labeled\ndmc.ColorInput(label=\"Pick color\") # ok, input and label is connected\ndmc.ColorInput(**{\"aria-label\": \"My input\"}) # ok, label is not visible but will be announced by screen readers\n```\n\n### StylesAPI\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n| Name              | Static selector                       | Description                                                         |\n|:------------------|:--------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| wrapper           | .mantine-ColorInput-wrapper           | Root element                                                        |\n| input             | .mantine-ColorInput-input             | Input element                                                       |\n| section           | .mantine-ColorInput-section           | Left and right sections                                             |\n| root              | .mantine-ColorInput-root              | Root element                                                        |\n| label             | .mantine-ColorInput-label             | Label element                                                       |\n| required          | .mantine-ColorInput-required          | Required asterisk element, rendered inside label                    |\n| description       | .mantine-ColorInput-description       | Description element                                                 |\n| error             | .mantine-ColorInput-error             | Error element                                                       |\n| preview           | .mantine-ColorInput-preview           | Color preview, displayed only when `format` supports alpha channel  |\n| body              | .mantine-ColorInput-body              | Contains alpha/hue sliders and color preview                        |\n| slider            | .mantine-ColorInput-slider            | Alpha and hue sliders root                                          |\n| sliderOverlay     | .mantine-ColorInput-sliderOverlay     | Element used to display various overlays over hue and alpha sliders |\n| saturation        | .mantine-ColorInput-saturation        | Saturation picker                                                   |\n| saturationOverlay | .mantine-ColorInput-saturationOverlay | Element used to display various overlays over saturation picker     |\n| sliders           | .mantine-ColorInput-sliders           | Contains alpha and hue sliders                                      |\n| thumb             | .mantine-ColorInput-thumb             | Thumb of all sliders                                                |\n| swatch            | .mantine-ColorInput-swatch            | Color swatch                                                        |\n| swatches          | .mantine-ColorInput-swatches          | Color swatches list                                                 |\n| dropdown          | .mantine-ColorInput-dropdown          | Popover dropdown                                                    |\n| colorPreview      | .mantine-ColorInput-colorPreview      | Color swatch preview in input left section                          |\n| eyeDropperButton  | .mantine-ColorInput-eyeDropperButton  | Eye dropper button                                                  |\n| eyeDropperIcon    | .mantine-ColorInput-eyeDropperIcon    | Default eye dropper icon                                            |\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### ColorInput\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

Slider to change opacity is displayed only for rgba\nand hsla formats.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, Input, Output, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Group(\n            justify=\"space-between\",\n            children=[\n                dmc.ColorPicker(id=\"colorpicker-format\", format=\"hex\", value=\"#343353\"),\n                dmc.Select(\n                    id=\"format-select\",\n                    data=[\n                        {\"label\": fmt.upper(), \"value\": fmt}\n                        for fmt in [\"hex\", \"hexa\", \"rgb\", \"rgba\", \"hsl\", \"hsla\"]\n                    ],\n                    value=\"hex\",\n                ),\n            ],\n        ),\n        dmc.Space(h=10),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"selected-color-format\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"colorpicker-format\", \"format\"), Input(\"format-select\", \"value\"))\ndef pick_format(value):\n    return value\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"selected-color-format\", \"children\"), Input(\"colorpicker-format\", \"value\")\n)\ndef pick_color(color):\n    return color\n```\n### With Swatches\n\nYou can add any number of predefined swatches and also set the number of swatches per row.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n# fmt: off\nswatches = [\n    \"#25262b\", \"#868e96\", \"#fa5252\", \"#e64980\", \"#be4bdb\", \"#7950f2\", \"#4c6ef5\",\n    \"#228be6\", \"#15aabf\", \"#12b886\", \"#40c057\", \"#82c91e\", \"#fab005\", \"#fd7e14\"\n]\n# fmt: on\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    gap=40,\n    children=[\n        dmc.ColorPicker(swatches=swatches),\n        dmc.ColorPicker(swatches=swatches, swatchesPerRow=9),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Without Picker\n\nTo display just the swatches and no picker, initialize the component with `withPicker=False`.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n# fmt: off\nswatches = [\n    \"#25262b\", \"#868e96\", \"#fa5252\", \"#e64980\", \"#be4bdb\", \"#7950f2\", \"#4c6ef5\",\n    \"#228be6\", \"#15aabf\", \"#12b886\", \"#40c057\", \"#82c91e\", \"#fab005\", \"#fd7e14\"\n]\n# fmt: on\n\ncomponent = dmc.ColorPicker(swatches=swatches, swatchesPerRow=7, withPicker=False)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

    "category": "Inputs",
    "content": "\n\n## InputWrapper  \nUse InputWrapper to add label, description and error fields to custom inputs.  \nCategory: Inputs  \n\nThe `InputWrapper` component is built into all Dash Mantine input components, such as `TextInput`, `NumberInput`,\n`Select`, `Chip`, and `Textarea`(and more!) **You do not need to wrap these components with `InputWrapper` as it’s already included.**  \n\nUse `InputWrapper` when working with input components from other libraries, like `dash-core-components`, to ensure \nconsistent styling of input components in your app.  \n\n### Usage\n\n\n### Custom TreeInput component\n\nHere is an example of adding an `InputWapper` to the `Tree` component.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nfrom dash import Input, Output, callback\n\n\ncomponent =  dmc.InputWrapper(\n    id=\"tree-wrapper\",\n    label=\"Tree input\",\n    description=\"This is a tree input\",\n    inputWrapperOrder=[\"label\", \"description\", \"error\", \"input\"],\n    withAsterisk=True,\n    children=[\n        dmc.Tree(\n            id=\"tree\",\n            checkboxes=True,\n            data=[\n                {\n                    \"label\": \"root\",\n                    \"value\": \"value\",\n                    \"children\": [\n                        {\"label\": \"child 1\", \"value\": \"child_1\"},\n                        {\"label\": \"child 2\", \"value\": \"child_2\"},\n                    ],\n                }\n            ],\n        )\n    ],\n)\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"tree-wrapper\", \"error\"),\n    Input(\"tree\", \"checked\"),\n)\ndef validate(checked):\n    tree_error = \"Select at least one\" if not checked else None\n    return tree_error\n```\n###  Avoid Unnecessary `InputWrapper` Usage  \n\nMost Mantine input components already include the `InputWrapper` internally, so you **should not** wrap them with `InputWrapper` yourself.  \n\nInstead, check the reference section for built-in props like `label`, `description`, and `error`, and use these props directly.\n\n**✅ Correct Usage: Use Component Props**\n```python\ndmc.Select(\n    label=\"My label\",\n    description=\"My description\"\n)\n```  \n\n**❌ Incorrect Usage: Avoid Wrapping with `InputWrapper`**\n```python\n# don't do this\ndmc.InputWrapper(\n    label=\"My label\",\n    description=\"My description\",\n    children=dmc.Select(...)  \n)\n```  \n\n### Accessibility\n\nNote that DMC input components with built-in `InputWrapper` are more accessible. For example, their labels\nare properly linked to inputs, making them screen-reader friendly and allowing users to focus the input by clicking\nthe label. This behavior does not apply when manually using `InputWrapper`.\n\nIt's possible to use the [htmlFor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLLabelElement/htmlFor) prop to\nlink the `InputWrapper` `label` prop to the input in the `children` prop .  However, it works only in certain components\nthat are accessible.  \n\n```python\nfrom dash import dcc\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n# this is accessible  (but better to use a dmc input component instead)\ndmc.InputWrapper(\n    label=\"my-input\",\n    htmlFor=\"dcc-input\",\n    children=dcc.Input(id=\"dcc-input\")\n)\n\n# the dcc.Dropdown is not accessible\ndmc.InputWrapper(\n    label=\"my-input\",\n    htmlFor=\"dcc-dropdown\",\n    children=dcc.Dropdown(id=\"dcc-dropdown\")\n)\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

Generally, if the `value` can be represented as \na number (e.g., 55, 1.28, -100), it will be treated as a number. However, there are specific cases where the value \ncannot be represented as a number and is instead treated as a string:\n\n - Empty State: An empty state is represented as an empty string (`''`). **To clear the value in a callback, use `''` instead of `None`.**\n- Exceeding Safe Integer Limits: If the number is larger than [Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) \nor smaller than [Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MIN_SAFE_INTEGER),\nit will be represented as a string (e.g., '90071992547409910').\n- Multiple Zeros: Numbers that consist only of zeros or have trailing zeros are represented as strings (e.g., '0.', '0.0', '-0.00', etc.).\n\n\n### min and max\n\nSet `min` and `max` props to limit the input value:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.NumberInput(\n    label=\"Enter value between 10 and 20\",\n    min=10,\n    max=20,\n    w=250,\n)\n```\n### Clamp behavior\nBy default, the `value` is clamped when the input is blurred. If you set `clampBehavior=\"strict\"`, it will not be\npossible to enter value outside of min/max range. Note that this option may cause issues if you have tight\n`min` and `max`, for example `min=10` and `max=20`. If you need to disable value clamping entirely, set `clampBehavior=\"none\"`.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.NumberInput(\n    label=\"You cannot enter number less than 0 or greater than 100\",\n    placeholder=\"You cannot enter number less than 0 or greater than 100\",\n    clampBehavior=\"strict\",\n    min=0,\n    max=100,\n    w=450,\n)\n```\n### Prefix and suffix\nSet `prefix` and `suffix` props to add given string to the start or end of the input value:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.NumberInput(\n        label=\"With prefix\",\n        placeholder=\"Dollars\",\n        prefix=\"$\",\n        value=100,\n        w=250,\n        mb=\"md\"\n    ),\n    dmc.NumberInput(\n        label=\"With suffix\",\n        placeholder=\"Percent\",\n        suffix=\"%\",\n        value=100,\n        w=250,\n        mt=\"md\"\n    ),\n])\n```\n### Negative numbers\nBy default, negative numbers are allowed. Set `allowNegative=False` to allow only positive numbers.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.NumberInput(\n    label=\"Negative numbers are not allowed\",\n    placeholder=\"Do not enter negative numbers\",\n    allowNegative=False,\n    w=300,\n)\n```\n### Decimal numbers\nBy default, decimal numbers are allowed. Set `allowDecimal=False` to allow only integers.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.NumberInput(\n    label=\"Decimal numbers are not allowed\",\n    placeholder=\"Do not enter decimal numbers\",\n    allowDecimal=False,\n    w=250,\n)\n```\n### Decimal scale\n`decimalScale` controls how many decimal places are allowed:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.NumberInput(\n        label=\"You can enter only 2 digits after decimal point\",\n        placeholder=\"Do not enter more than 2 decimals\",\n        decimalScale=2,\n        w=250,\n        mb=\"md\"\n    ),\n    dmc.NumberInput(\n        label=\"Number input with decimal steps\",\n        value=0.05,\n        decimalScale=2,\n        min=-1,\n        step=0.05,\n        max=1,\n        w=250,\n        mt=\"md\"\n    )\n])\n```\n### Fixed decimal scale\nSet `fixedDecimalScale=True` to always display fixed number of decimal places:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.NumberInput(\n    label=\"Always show 2 digits after decimal point\",\n    placeholder=\"Do not enter more than 2\",\n    decimalScale=2,\n    fixedDecimalScale=True,\n    value=2.2,\n    w=250,\n)\n```\n### Decimal separator\nSet `decimalSeparator` to change decimal separator character:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.NumberInput(\n    label=\"Custom decimal separator\",\n    decimalSeparator=\",\",\n    value=20.234,\n    w=250,\n)\n```\n### Thousand separator\nSet `thousandSeparator` prop to separate thousands with a character. You can control\ngrouping logic with `thousandsGroupStyle`, it accepts: `thousand`, `lakh`, `wan`, `none` values.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n\n    dmc.NumberInput(\n        label=\"Thousands are separated with a comma\",\n        placeholder=\"Thousands are separated with a comma\",\n        thousandSeparator=\",\",\n        value=1_000_000,\n        w=400\n    ),\n\n    dmc.NumberInput(\n        label=\"Thousands are separated with a space\",\n        placeholder=\"Thousands are separated with a space\",\n        thousandSeparator=\" \",\n        value=1_000_000,\n        mt=\"md\",\n        w=400\n    )\n])\n```\n### Left and right sections\n\nYou can use DashIconify to add icon to the NumberInput.\n\n`NumberInput` supports `leftSection` and `rightSection` props. These sections are rendered with absolute position \ninside the input wrapper. You can use them to display icons, input controls or any other elements.\n\nYou can use the following props to control sections styles and content:\n\n- `rightSection/leftSection` – components to render on the corresponding side of input\n- `rightSectionWidth/leftSectionWidth` – controls width of the right section and padding on the corresponding side of the input. By default, it is controlled by component size prop.\n- `rightSectionPointerEvents/leftSectionPointerEvents` – controls pointer-events property of the section. If you want to render a non-interactive element, set it to none to pass clicks through to the input.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.NumberInput(\n        label=\"With left section\",\n        description=\"From 0 to infinity, in steps of 5\",\n        value=5,\n        min=0,\n        step=5,\n        leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"fa6-solid:weight-scale\"),\n        w=250,\n    ),\n    dmc.NumberInput(\n        label=\"With right section\",\n        description=\"From 0 to infinity, in steps of 5\",\n        value=5,\n        min=0,\n        step=5,\n        rightSection=DashIconify(icon=\"fa6-solid:weight-scale\"),\n        w=250,\n    )\n])\n```\n### Increment/decrement on hold\n\nSet `stepHoldDelay` and `stepHoldInterval` props to define behavior when increment/decrement controls are clicked and \nheld.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.NumberInput(\n    label=\"Step on hold\",\n    description=\"Step the value when clicking and holding the arrows\",\n    stepHoldDelay=500,\n    stepHoldInterval=100,\n    value=0,\n    w=250,\n)\n```\n### Remove controls\n\nControls are not rendered in these cases:\n\n- `hideControls` prop is set to `True`\n- Input is disabled\n- `variant` prop is set to \"unstyled\"\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.NumberInput(label=\"By default controls are visible\", w=250),\n        dmc.NumberInput(\n            label=\"Hide controls\", hideControls=True, w=250\n        ),\n        dmc.NumberInput(\n            label=\"Disabled and hide controls\",\n            disabled=True,\n            hideControls=True,\n            w=250,\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Disabled state\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.NumberInput(disabled=True, label=\"Disabled input\", placeholder=\"Disabled input\", p=\"lg\"),\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

Component provides an option to toggle password \nvisibility, if you do not want this feature, use [TextInput](/components/textinput) component with `type='password'`.\n\n### Invalid State and Error\n\nUse `error` prop to convey an error with an error message and a red border around the input.\n\nNote: Dash adds thick red outline to the input element with `:invalid` pseudo-class. This conflicts with Mantine. \nIn order to correct this, just add the following css to your app.\n\n```css\ninput:invalid {\n    outline: none !important;\n}\n```\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.PasswordInput(\n            label=\"Your password\",\n            placeholder=\"Your password\",\n            w=250,\n            error=True,\n        ),\n        dmc.PasswordInput(\n            label=\"Your password\",\n            placeholder=\"Your password\",\n            w=250,\n            error=\"Invalid Password\",\n        ),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Disabled State\n\nConvey disabled input with `disabled` prop.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.PasswordInput(\n    label=\"Password\",\n    placeholder=\"Your password\",\n    w=200,\n    disabled=True,\n)\n```\n### With Icon\n\nAdd icon to the left side of the input.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.PasswordInput(\n    label=\"Your password:\",\n    w=250,\n    placeholder=\"Your password\",\n    leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"bi:shield-lock\"),\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

The Radio component is a wrapper for input type radio.  Use Stack or Group to arrange multiple Radio items\n\n### Color\n\nIn a RadioGroup component, the color property can be customized at the individual Radio level.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\n    [\"react\", \"React\", \"blue\"],\n    [\"ng\", \"Angular\", \"orange\"],\n    [\"svelte\", \"Svelte\", \"red\"],\n    [\"dash\", \"Dash\", \"green\"],\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.RadioGroup(\n    children=dmc.Stack([dmc.Radio(l, value=k, color=c) for k, l, c in data]),\n    value=\"ng\",\n    size=\"sm\",\n)\n```\n### Size\n\nYou can set the size of all the Radio items by using the `size` prop in the RadioGroup component.  Use one of xs, sm, md, lg and xl.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.RadioGroup(\n            children=dmc.Group(\n                [dmc.Radio(i, value=i) for i in [\"USA\", \"Canada\", \"France\"]], my=10\n            ),\n            value=\"USA\",\n            label=\"Size Example - small\",\n            size=\"sm\",\n            mt=10,\n        ),\n        dmc.RadioGroup(\n            children=dmc.Group(\n                [dmc.Radio(i, value=i) for i in [\"USA\", \"Canada\", \"France\"]], my=10\n            ),\n            value=\"USA\",\n            label=\"Size Example - large\",\n            size=\"lg\",\n            mt=30,\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Group or Stack\n\nIn a RadioGroup component, the Radio items can be arranged by using the Group or Stack components.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\ndata = [[\"react\", \"React\"], [\"ng\", \"Angular\"], [\"svelte\", \"Svelte\"], [\"vue\", \"Vue\"]]\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.RadioGroup(\n            children=dmc.Group([dmc.Radio(l, value=k) for k, l in data], my=10),\n            value=\"react\",\n            label=\"Select your favorite framework/library\",\n            size=\"sm\",\n            my=10,\n        ),\n        dmc.RadioGroup(\n            children=dmc.Stack([dmc.Radio(l, value=k) for k, l in data], my=10),\n            value=\"react\",\n            label=\"Select your favorite framework/library\",\n            size=\"sm\",\n            mt=10,\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Deselectable RadioGroup\n\nTo enable deselecting a radio chip, set `deselectable=True`\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\ndata = [[\"react\", \"React\"], [\"ng\", \"Angular\"], [\"svelte\", \"Svelte\"], [\"vue\", \"Vue\"]]\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.RadioGroup(\n            children=dmc.Group([dmc.Radio(l, value=k) for k, l in data], my=10),\n            value=\"react\",\n            label=\"Select your favorite framework/library\",\n            size=\"sm\",\n            my=10,\n            deselectable=True\n        ),\n\n    ]\n)\n```\n### RadioIndicator component\n\n`RadioIndicator` looks exactly the same as `Radio` component, but it does not have any semantic meaning, it's just a \nvisual representation of radio state. You can use it in any place where you need to display radio state without any \ninteraction related to the indicator. For example, it is useful in cards based on buttons, trees, etc.\n\n> Note that `RadioIndicator` cannot be focused or selected with keyboard. It is not accessible and should not be used as\na replacement for Radio component.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group([\n    dmc.RadioIndicator(),\n    dmc.RadioIndicator(checked=True),\n    dmc.RadioIndicator(disabled=True),\n    dmc.RadioIndicator(disabled=True, checked=True)\n])\n```\n### RadioCard component\n\nRadioCard component can be used as a replacement for `Radio` to build custom cards/buttons/other things that work as\nradios. The root element of the component has `role=\"radio\"` attribute, it is accessible by default and supports the\nsame keyboard interactions as `input[type=\"radio\"]`.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.RadioCard(\n    withBorder=True,\n    p=\"md\",\n    checked=True,\n    children=[\n        dmc.Center([\n            dmc.RadioIndicator(),\n            dmc.Text(\"RadioCard\", size=\"xl\", pl=\"sm\"),\n        ], inline=True),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### RadioCard with RadioGroup\n\nYou can use `RadioCard` with `RadioGroup` the same way as `Radio` component.\n\nNote - do not set the `checked` prop in the `RadioIndicator` component otherwise the `RadioIndicator` will not be updated.\nThis example also shows how to add hover styles\n\n```python\n\nfrom dash import  Input, Output, callback\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndef make_radiocard(label, description):\n    return dmc.RadioCard(\n        withBorder=True,\n        p=\"md\",\n        mt=\"md\",\n        className=\"checkboxcard-root\",\n        value=label,\n        children=[\n            dmc.Group([\n                dmc.RadioIndicator(),\n                dmc.Box([\n                    dmc.Text(label, lh=\"1.3\", fz=\"md\", fw=\"bold\" ),\n                    dmc.Text(description, size=\"sm\", c=\"dimmed\"),\n                ])\n            ], wrap=\"nowrap\", align=\"flex-start\"),\n        ]\n    )\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n    dmc.RadioGroup(\n        id=\"radiocard-group\",\n        label= \"RadioGroup label\",\n        value=\"RadioCard 1\",\n        description=\"This is a RadioGroup description\",\n        deselectable=True,\n        children=[\n            make_radiocard(f\"RadioCard {i}\", f\"RadioCard description {i}\")\n            for i in range(1, 5)\n        ]\n    ),\n    dmc.Box(id=\"radio-group-out\"),\n])\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"radiocard-group-out\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"radiocard-group\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update(checked):\n   return f\"Selected: {checked}\"\n```\n\n```css\n/* used for both CheckboxCard and RadioCard*/\n.checkboxcard-root {\n    position: relative;\n    padding: var(--mantine-spacing-md);\n    transition: border-color 150ms ease;\n\n    &[data-checked] {\n        border-color: var(--mantine-primary-color-filled);\n    }\n}\n\n.checkboxcard-root:hover {\n    background-color: light-dark(\n            var(--mantine-color-gray-0),\n            var(--mantine-color-dark-6)\n    );\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element.

There are no known breaking changes; however, review the migration guide\n for details.\n- DMC versions prior to 2.3.0 use Tiptap v2.9.\n  \n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncontent = \"\"\"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Welcome to Mantine rich text editor</h2><p><code>RichTextEditor</code> component focuses on usability and is designed to be as simple as possible to bring a familiar editing experience to regular users. <code>RichTextEditor</code> is based on <a href=\"https://tiptap.dev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tiptap.dev</a> and supports all of its features:</p><ul><li>General text formatting: <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, <u>underline</u>, <s>strike-through</s> </li><li>Headings (h1-h6)</li><li>Sub and super scripts (<sup>&lt;sup /&gt;</sup> and <sub>&lt;sub /&gt;</sub> tags)</li><li>Ordered and bullet lists</li><li>Text align&nbsp;</li><li>And all <a href=\"https://tiptap.dev/extensions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">other extensions</a></li></ul>\"\"\"\n\ncomponent = dmc.RichTextEditor(\n    html=content,\n    toolbar={\n        \"sticky\": True,\n        \"controlsGroups\": [\n            [\n                \"Bold\",\n                \"Italic\",\n                \"Underline\",\n                \"Strikethrough\",\n                \"ClearFormatting\",\n                \"Highlight\",\n                \"Code\",\n            ],\n            [\"H1\", \"H2\", \"H3\", \"H4\"],\n            [\n                \"Blockquote\",\n                \"Hr\",\n                \"BulletList\",\n                \"OrderedList\",\n                \"Subscript\",\n                \"Superscript\",\n            ],\n            [\"Link\", \"Unlink\"],\n            [\"AlignLeft\", \"AlignCenter\", \"AlignJustify\", \"AlignRight\"],\n            [\"Undo\", \"Redo\"],\n        ],\n    },\n)\n```\n### Editing Shortcuts:\n\n- Keyboard Shortcuts:  \n  - Utilize [Tiptap’s keyboard shortcuts](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/core-concepts/keyboard-shortcuts#text-formatting) for quick text formatting.   \n\n- Markdown Shortcuts:  \n  - Markdown-style formatting is supported. For example:  \n    - Use `#` followed by a space for headings.  \n    - Use `-` or `*` for bullet lists.  \n  - See the full list of [Markdown shortcuts](https://tiptap.dev/docs/examples/basics/markdown-shortcuts#page-title).\n\n### Tiptap Extensions  \n\nExtensions expand the capabilities of Tiptap in `RichTextEditor`. DMC provides a predefined set of extensions, all\nenabled by default. You can customize these as needed.\n\n Need an extension that’s not included? Open a [feature request on GitHub](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/issues).\n We prioritize requests based on popularity and bundle size impact to keep DMC lightweight and efficient.\n\n#### Default Extensions\nBy default, all the available extensions are enabled:  \n\n```python\ndmc.RichTextEditor(       \n    extensions=[\n        {\"StarterKit\": {\"codeBlock\": False}},\n        \"CodeBlockLowlight\", # available in DMC >= 2.4.0\n        \"Superscript\",\n        \"Subscript\",\n        \"Highlight\",\n        \"Table\",\n        \"TableCell\",\n        \"TableHeader\",\n        \"TableRow\",\n        {\"TextAlign\": {\"types\": [\"heading\", \"paragraph\"]}},\n        {\"Placeholder\": {\"placeholder\": \"Write or paste content here...\"}},\n        \"Color\",\n        \"TextStyle\",\n        \"Image\",\n        # The following is available in DMC >= 2.3.0\n        \"BackgroundColor\",\n        \"FontFamily\",\n        \"FontSize\",\n        \"LineHeight\",\n        # The following is included in StarterKit in DMC >=2.3.0\n        # \"Underline\",\n        # \"Link\",\n    ]\n)\n```  \n\nThe `StarterKit` extension includes essential text-editing features such as:  \n\n- Text Formatting: `Text`, `Bold`, `Italic`, `Strike`, `Code`, `Underline`, `Link`\n- Headings & Lists: `Heading`, `OrderedList`, `BulletList`, `ListItem`  \n- Structural Elements: `Paragraph`, `Blockquote`, `CodeBlock`, `HardBreak`, `HorizontalRule`, `Document`  \n- Cursor & History Features: `Dropcursor`, `Gapcursor`, `History`  \n- Source Code editing: `SourceCode`\n\n#### Customizing Extensions\n\nYou can modify the enabled extensions by setting the `extensions` prop. This allows you to:  \n- Exclude features you don’t want  \n- Adjust settings for specific extensions  \n\nEach extension can be defined in two ways:  \n- As a string to use default settings (for example, `\"Color\"`)  \n- As a dictionary to specify configuration options (for example `{\"TextAlign\": {\"types\": [\"heading\", \"paragraph\"]}}`)  \n\n\nSome features require multiple extensions. For example:  \n- color formatting requires both `\"Color\"` and `\"TextStyle\"`.  \n- Tables require `\"Table\"`, `\"TableCell\"`, `\"TableHeader\"`, and `\"TableRow\"`.  \n\nAt a minimum, ensure that `\"StarterKit\"` is included:  \n```python\nextensions=[\"StarterKit\"]\n```  \nFor a full list of extensions and configuration options, refer to the [Tiptap documentation](https://tiptap.dev/docs/extensions).\n\n\n Note:  Setting the `extensions` prop replaces the default list, so if you exclude an extension, for example,\n`\"Image\"`, that feature will no longer be available.  Be sure to include all the features from the default extension that you need.\n\nHere are the default `extensions` for corresponding DMC versions.\n\n\n```python\n# RichTextEditor default extensions in dmc version V2.4.0\nextensions = [\n    { 'StarterKit': { 'codeBlock': False } },\n    'CodeBlockLowlight',\n    'Superscript',\n    'Subscript',\n    'Highlight',\n    'Table',\n    'TableCell',\n    'TableHeader',\n    'TableRow',\n    { 'Placeholder': { 'placeholder': 'Write or paste content here...' } },\n    { 'TextAlign': { 'types': ['heading', 'paragraph'] } },\n    'Color',\n    'TextStyle',\n    'BackgroundColor',\n    'FontFamily',\n    'FontSize',\n    'LineHeight',\n    'Image',\n]\n```\n\n```python\n# RichTextEditor default extensions in dmc version V2.3.0\nextensions = [\n    'StarterKit',\n    'Superscript',\n    'Subscript',\n    'Highlight',\n    'Table',\n    'TableCell',\n    'TableHeader',\n    'TableRow',\n    { 'Placeholder': { 'placeholder': 'Write or paste content here...' } },\n    { 'TextAlign': { 'types': ['heading', 'paragraph'] } },\n    'Color',\n    'TextStyle',\n    'BackgroundColor',\n    'FontFamily',\n    'FontSize',\n    'LineHeight',\n    'Image',\n]\n```\n\n```python\n\n# RichTextEditor default extensions in dmc version V1.1.0\nextensions = [\n    'StarterKit',\n    'Underline',\n    'Link',\n    'Superscript',\n    'Subscript',\n    'Highlight',\n    'Table',\n    'TableCell',\n    'TableHeader',\n    'TableRow',\n    {'Placeholder': {'placeholder': 'Write or paste content here...'}},\n    {'TextAlign': {'types': ['heading', 'paragraph']}},\n    'Color',\n    'TextStyle',\n    'Image',\n]\n```\n\n\n### Toolbar Controls \n\nCustomize the toolbar by grouping control icons using the `controlsGroups` parameter. Each nested list within\n`controlsGroups` represents a separate group of toolbar icons.\n\n Note that even if a toolbar icon is not included, features provided by enabled extensions can still be accessed\n through  keyboard shortcuts and Markdown syntax.\n\n```python\ndmc.RichTextEditor(\n    toolbar={           \n        \"controlsGroups\": [\n            [\n                \"Bold\",\n                \"Italic\",\n                \"Underline\",               \n            ], # First group (text formatting)\n            \n            [\"H1\", \"H2\", \"H3\", \"H4\"], # second group (headings)\n        ]\n    }     \n)\n```\nHere are the control icons available for use in the `toolbar`:\n\n**Controls included with StarterKit extension:**\n\n- H1\n- H2\n- H3\n- H4\n- H5\n- H6\n- BulletList\n- OrderedList\n- Bold\n- Italic\n- Strikethrough\n- ClearFormatting\n- Blockquote\n- Code\n- CodeBlock\n- Hr\n- Undo\n- Redo\n- SourceCode\n\nThe following is included by default in DMC >=2.3.0:\n- Link\n- Unlink\n- Underline\n\n**Controls that require TextAlign extension:**\n- AlignLeft\n- AlignRight\n- AlignCenter\n- AlignJustify\n\n**Controls that require both Color and TextStyle extensions:**\n- ColorPicker\n- Color\n- UnsetColor\n\n**Other controls with required extensions:**\n- Underline requires `Underline` extension in DMC <=2.3.0\n- Superscript requires `Superscript` extension\n- Subscript requires `Subscript` extension\n- Highlight requires `Highlight` extension\n\n\n### Typography styles\nBy default, `RichTextEditor` renders content with [TypographyStylesProvider](/components/typographystylesprovider) and\nsome additional styles. You can disable these styles by setting `withTypographyStyles=False`.  Then you can add your own \nCSS files, or style with the Styles API.\n\n\n```python\n dmc.RichTextEditor(       \n     withTypographyStyles=False\n)\n```\n\n### Placeholder\n\nTo use the placeholder or change the placeholder default text, include (at least) the following extensions:\n\n\n```python\nfrom dash import html\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.RichTextEditor(\n    extensions=[\n        \"StarterKit\",\n        {\"Placeholder\": {\"placeholder\": \"Write something...\"}},\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Text color\n\nYou can use the following toolbar controls to change text color:\n\n- `ColorPicker` – allows to pick colors from given predefined color swatches and with `ColorPicker` component\n- `Color` – allows to apply given color with one click\n- `UnsetColor` – clears color styles\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncolorpicker_colors = [\n    \"#25262b\",\n    \"#868e96\",\n    \"#fa5252\",\n    \"#e64980\",\n    \"#be4bdb\",\n    \"#7950f2\",\n    \"#4c6ef5\",\n    \"#228be6\",\n    \"#15aabf\",\n    \"#12b886\",\n    \"#40c057\",\n    \"#82c91e\",\n    \"#fab005\",\n    \"#fd7e14\",\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.RichTextEditor(\n    html=\"Apply some colors to this text\",\n    extensions=[\n        \"StarterKit\",\n        \"Color\",\n        \"TextStyle\",  # required when using Color\n    ],\n    toolbar={\n        \"sticky\": True,\n        \"stickyOffset\": 60,\n        \"controlsGroups\": [\n            [\n                {\"ColorPicker\": {\"colors\": colorpicker_colors}},\n            ],\n            [\n                {\"Color\": {\"color\": \"red\"}},\n                {\"Color\": {\"color\": \"green\"}},\n                {\"Color\": {\"color\": \"blue\"}},\n            ],\n            [\"UnsetColor\"],\n        ],\n    },\n)\n```\n### Table\n\nThe tables will be styles with a Mantine theme. For more information refer to the [TypographyStylesProvider](/components/typographystylesprovider) section.\nYou can disable these styles by setting `withTypographyStyles=False`\n\nTo add controls in the toolbar for table features, see the Custom Controls section below.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ntable = \"\"\"\n    <table>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Name</th>\n          <th colspan=\"3\">Description</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Cyndi Lauper</td>\n          <td>Singer</td>\n          <td>Songwriter</td>\n          <td>Actress</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Bruce Springsteen</td>\n          <td>Singer</td>\n          <td>Songwriter</td>\n          <td>Actor</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n\"\"\"\n\ncomponent = dmc.RichTextEditor(\n    html=table,\n    extensions=[\n        \"StarterKit\",\n        \"Table\",\n        \"TableCell\",\n        \"TableHeader\",\n        \"TableRow\",\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Image\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncontent = \"\"\"\n<p>This is a basic example of implementing images. Drag to re-order.</p>\n<img src=\"https://placehold.co/800x400\" />\n<img src=\"https://placehold.co/800x400/6A00F5/white\" />      \n\"\"\"\n\ncomponent = dmc.RichTextEditor(\n    html=content,\n    extensions=[\n        \"StarterKit\",\n        \"Image\",\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Code highlight  \n\n*New in V2.4.0*  \n\nTo use code highlight you will need to include at least the following extensions:\n\n\n```python\n dmc.RichTextEditor(       \n     extensions=[\n         {\"StarterKit\": {\"codeBlock\": False}},\n        \"CodeBlockLowlight\",         \n         # other needed extensions\n     ],\n)\n```\nNote:  You must set `{\"codeBlock\": False}` in the `StarterKit` configuration to prevent a conflict with the more\nadvanced `CodeBlockLowlight` extension. \n\nCurrent supported languages: \n  ts\n  js\n  python/ py \n  css\n  bash / shell  \n  text\n\nSet language to text to supress code highlighting.\n\nIf you would like other languages included, please [open a feature request on our GitHub.](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/issues)\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncode_example = \"\"\"import dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Dash\n\napp = Dash()\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    dmc.Alert(\n       \"Welcome to Dash Mantine Components\",\n       title=\"Hello!\",\n       color=\"violet\",\n    )\n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\"\"\"\n\ncomponent= dmc.RichTextEditor(\n    html=f\"<p>Regular paragraph</p><pre><code>{code_example}</code></pre>\",\n    extensions=[\n        {\"StarterKit\": { \"codeBlock\": False }},\n        \"CodeBlockLowlight\"\n    ],\n    toolbar={\n        \"controlsGroups\": [\n            [\n                \"Bold\",\n                \"Italic\",\n                \"Underline\",\n                \"Strikethrough\",\n                \"CodeBlock\"\n            ],\n        ],\n    },\n)\n```\n### Source code mode\n\nYou can use the `SourceCode` control to see and edit source code of editor content:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncontent= '<p>Source code control example</p><p>New line with <strong>bold text</strong></p><p>New line with <em>italic</em> <em>text</em></p>'\n\ncomponent =dmc.RichTextEditor(\n    html=content,\n    toolbar={\n        \"sticky\": True,\n        \"controlsGroups\": [\n            [\"SourceCode\"],\n            [\n                \"Blockquote\",\n                \"Bold\",\n                \"Italic\",\n                \"Underline\",\n                \"Strikethrough\",\n                \"ClearFormatting\",\n                \"Highlight\",\n            ],\n        ],\n    },\n)\n```\n### Focus\n\n*New in V2.4.0*  \n\nUse the `focus` prop to control the editor's focus state.\n\n- `focus=True` - Focus the editor at the current cursor position\n- `focus=False` - Blur (remove focus from) the editor\n- `focus=\"start\"` - Focus at the start of the document\n- `focus=\"end\"` - Focus at the end of the document\n- `focus=10` - Focus at a specific position (character offset) Positive values start at the beginning of the document - negative values at the end.\n- `focus=\"all\"` - Focus and select all content\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import  Input, Output, callback, ctx, no_update\n\ncomponent =  dmc.Box([\n    dmc.Group([\n        dmc.Button(\"Focus Start\", id=\"rte-btn-focus-start\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Focus End\", id=\"rte-btn-focus-end\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Blur\", id=\"rte-btn-blur\"),\n    ]),\n    dmc.RichTextEditor(\n        id=\"rte-focus\",\n        html=\"<p>Click the buttons to control focus.</p>\",\n    ),\n])\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"rte-focus\", \"focus\"),\n    Input(\"rte-btn-focus-start\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    Input(\"rte-btn-focus-end\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    Input(\"rte-btn-blur\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True\n)\ndef control_focus(start, end, blur):\n    if not ctx.triggered:\n        return no_update\n\n    button_id = ctx.triggered_id\n    if button_id == \"rte-btn-focus-start\":\n        return \"start\"\n    elif button_id == \"rte-btn-focus-end\":\n        return \"end\"\n    elif button_id == \"rte-btn-blur\":\n        return False\n```\n### Editable \n\n*New in V2.4.0*  \n\nThe `editable` prop controls whether the editor content can be modified. When `editable=False`:\n- The editor becomes read-only\n- Users can still select and copy text\n- The toolbar is automatically hidden\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import  Input, Output, callback\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n    dmc.Switch(\n        id=\"rte-toggle-editable\",\n        label=\"Editable\",\n        checked=True,\n    ),\n    dmc.RichTextEditor(\n        id=\"rte-editable\",\n        html=\"<p>This editor can be toggled between editable and read-only mode.</p>\",\n        editable=True,\n        toolbar={\n            \"controlsGroups\": [\n                [\n                    \"Bold\",\n                    \"Italic\",\n                    \"Underline\",\n                    \"Strikethrough\",\n                    \"CodeBlock\"\n                ],\n            ],\n        },\n    ),\n])\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"rte-editable\", \"editable\"),\n    Input(\"rte-toggle-editable\", \"checked\"),\n)\ndef toggle_editable(checked):\n    return checked\n```\n### Sticky toolbar\nSet `sticky` prop on `RichTextEditor` `toolbar` prop to make toolbar sticky, control top property with `stickyOffset`. \nFor example, in the dmc docs website there is a header with 60px height, in this case we will need to set \n`stickyOffset=60` to make sticky position correctly with fixed positioned header element.\n\nNote the sticky toolbar as you scroll past the example below.\n\n\n### Subtle Variant  \n\n`variant=\"subtle\"` removes borders from the controls groups, makes controls larger and reduces spacing of the toolbar:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.RichTextEditor(\n    html=\"Subtle rich text editor variant\",\n    extensions=[\n        \"StarterKit\",\n        \"Highlight\",\n    ],\n    toolbar={\n        \"sticky\": True,\n        \"stickyOffset\": 60,\n        \"variant\": \"subtle\",\n        \"controlsGroups\": [\n            [\n                \"Bold\",\n                \"Italic\",\n                \"Underline\",\n                \"Strikethrough\",\n                \"ClearFormatting\",\n                \"Highlight\",\n                \"Code\",\n            ],\n        ],\n    },\n)\n```\n### Labels and localization\n`RichTextEditor` supports changing labels for all controls with labels prop:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncolorpicker_colors = [\n    \"#25262b\",\n    \"#868e96\",\n    \"#fa5252\",\n    \"#e64980\",\n    \"#be4bdb\",\n    \"#7950f2\",\n    \"#4c6ef5\",\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.RichTextEditor(\n    html=\"Custom button labels\",\n    toolbar={\n        \"sticky\": True,\n        \"stickyOffset\": 60,\n        \"controlsGroups\": [\n            [\n                \"Bold\",\n                \"Italic\",\n                \"Underline\",\n                \"Strikethrough\",\n                \"ClearFormatting\",\n                \"Highlight\",\n                \"Code\",\n            ],\n            [{\"ColorPicker\": {\"colors\": colorpicker_colors}}],\n            [\n                {\"Color\": {\"color\": \"red\"}},\n                {\"Color\": {\"color\": \"green\"}},\n                {\"Color\": {\"color\": \"blue\"}},\n            ],\n            [\"UnsetColor\"],\n        ],\n    },\n    labels={\n        \"boldControlLabel\": \"Make text bold\",\n        \"italicControlLabel\": \"Make text bold\",\n        \"colorPickerControlLabel\": \"Text color\", # label for control in toolbar\n        \"colorPickerColorLabel\": \"Color number: {color}\", # include color in label in the color swatch. Use f-string format\n        \"colorControlLabel\": \"Set Text color {color}\" # include color in label with f-string format\n        # ...other labels\n    },\n)\n```\nMost labels are used to add `aria-label` and `title` attributes to the toolbar controls.  Some labels support f-string\nformatting for dynamic values. If you do not provide all labels, then they will be merged with the default labels.\n\nHere are all available labels with their defaults:\n```python\ndefault_labels = {\n    # Controls labels\n    \"linkControlLabel\": \"Link\",\n    \"colorPickerControlLabel\": \"Text color\",\n    \"highlightControlLabel\": \"Highlight text\",\n    \"colorControlLabel\": \"Set text color {color}\",  # Use f-string format to include color in label\n    \"boldControlLabel\": \"Bold\",\n    \"italicControlLabel\": \"Italic\",\n    \"underlineControlLabel\": \"Underline\",\n    \"strikeControlLabel\": \"Strikethrough\",\n    \"clearFormattingControlLabel\": \"Clear formatting\",\n    \"unlinkControlLabel\": \"Remove link\",\n    \"bulletListControlLabel\": \"Bullet list\",\n    \"orderedListControlLabel\": \"Ordered list\",\n    \"h1ControlLabel\": \"Heading 1\",\n    \"h2ControlLabel\": \"Heading 2\",\n    \"h3ControlLabel\": \"Heading 3\",\n    \"h4ControlLabel\": \"Heading 4\",\n    \"h5ControlLabel\": \"Heading 5\",\n    \"h6ControlLabel\": \"Heading 6\",\n    \"blockquoteControlLabel\": \"Blockquote\",\n    \"alignLeftControlLabel\": \"Align text: left\",\n    \"alignCenterControlLabel\": \"Align text: center\",\n    \"alignRightControlLabel\": \"Align text: right\",\n    \"alignJustifyControlLabel\": \"Align text: justify\",\n    \"codeControlLabel\": \"Code\",\n    \"codeBlockControlLabel\": \"Code block\",\n    \"subscriptControlLabel\": \"Subscript\",\n    \"superscriptControlLabel\": \"Superscript\",\n    \"unsetColorControlLabel\": \"Unset color\",\n    \"hrControlLabel\": \"Horizontal line\",\n    \"undoControlLabel\": \"Undo\",\n    \"redoControlLabel\": \"Redo\",\n\n    # Task list\n    \"tasksControlLabel\": \"Task list\",\n    \"tasksSinkLabel\": \"Decrease task level\",\n    \"tasksLiftLabel\": \"Increase task level\",\n\n    # Link editor\n    \"linkEditorInputLabel\": \"Enter URL\",\n    \"linkEditorInputPlaceholder\": \"https://example.com/\",\n    \"linkEditorExternalLink\": \"Open link in a new tab\",\n    \"linkEditorInternalLink\": \"Open link in the same tab\",\n    \"linkEditorSave\": \"Save\",\n\n    # Color picker control\n    \"colorPickerCancel\": \"Cancel\",\n    \"colorPickerClear\": \"Clear color\",\n    \"colorPickerColorPicker\": \"Color picker\",\n    \"colorPickerPalette\": \"Color palette\",\n    \"colorPickerSave\": \"Save\",\n    \"colorPickerColorLabel\": \"Set Text color {color}\",  # Use f-string format to include color in color swatch label\n}\n```\n\n### JSON or HTML Content  \n\nThe editor supports content in either [JSON (ProseMirror) or HTML format](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/core-concepts/schema). You can specify the format using the `json`\nor `html` prop. If both props are set, `json` takes precedence.  \n\nNote: While users can type Markdown-style text into `RichTextEditor`, the component does not parse or render supplied text in Markdown\ncontent.  To render Markdown text, use the `dcc.Markdown` component instead.\n\n#### When to Use Each Format:  \n- **JSON (ProseMirror)**: Ideal for structured data storage (databases, APIs) or programmatic content manipulation (e.g., dynamically adding elements).  \n- **HTML**: Useful for direct rendering in a browser, email clients, or using with components like `dcc.Markdown`.  \n\nNote that the schema is very strict.  For example, if you use `This is <strong>important</strong>`, but don’t have any \n[extension](/components/richtexteditor#tiptap-extensions) that handles strong tags, you’ll only see `This is important` – without the bold formatting..\n\nFor details on the schema and ProseMirror format, see the [Tiptap documentation](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/core-concepts/schema).\n\nTry editing the content in this example to see the JSON and HTML format:\n```python\nfrom dash import Input, Output, html, callback\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncontent = \"\"\"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Welcome to Mantine rich text editor</h2>\"\"\"\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.RichTextEditor(\n            html=content,\n            extensions=[\n                \"StarterKit\",\n            ],\n            toolbar={\n                \"controlsGroups\": [\n                    [\n                        \"Bold\",\n                        \"Italic\",\n                        \"Underline\",\n                        \"Strikethrough\",\n                    ],\n                ],\n            },\n            id=\"rte-content\",\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(\"html content:\", mt=\"lg\"),\n        dmc.Paper(id=\"rte-content-html\", withBorder=True, mb=\"lg\", p=\"md\"),\n        dmc.Text(\"json content:\"),\n        dmc.Paper(id=\"rte-content-json\", withBorder=True, p=\"md\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"rte-content-html\", \"children\"), Input(\"rte-content\", \"html\"))\ndef update_content(content: str):\n    return f\"{content}\"\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"rte-content-json\", \"children\"), Input(\"rte-content\", \"json\"))\ndef update_content(content: str):\n    return f\"{content}\"\n```\n### Custom controls\nUse `CustomControl` in the `controlsGroups` to create create custom controls in the `toolbar`. Note that you will need \nto set `aria-label` attribute to make control visible for screen readers.\n\n\nTiptap version note:  \n\n- DMC 2.3.0 and later uses [Tiptap v3.3 commands](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/api/commands).\n- Older versions of DMC used [Tiptap v2.9 commands](https://v2.tiptap.dev/docs/editor/api/commands).\n\nUse the appropriate Tiptap documentation above to see the full list of editor commands available for your custom controls.\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder.

This allows you full access to the editor API including executing commands, inspecting\ncontent, and updating the editor state.  See the [Tiptap editor API](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/api/commands) for more details.\n\n\nThis returns the Tiptap editor instance for the specified component ID, or `undefined` if the editor doesn't exist:\n\n```javascript\nconst editor = dash_mantine_components.getEditor('editor-id');\n```\n\nThis example shows how to access the editor in a clientside callback and provide a word count of the content.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Dash, Input, Output, clientside_callback\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n    dmc.RichTextEditor(\n        id=\"get-editor-id\",\n        toolbar={\n                \"controlsGroups\": [\n                    [\n                        \"Bold\",\n                        \"Italic\",\n                        \"Underline\",\n                        \"Strikethrough\",\n                    ],\n                ],\n            },\n        html=\"<p>Try typing some text in this editor. Click the button below to see your character and word count.</p>\"\n    ),\n    dmc.Button(\"Get Stats\", id=\"btn-rte-stats\", n_clicks=0),\n    dmc.Box(id=\"stats\"),\n])\n\nclientside_callback(\n    \"\"\"\n    function(n_clicks) {\n        if (n_clicks > 0) {\n            const editor = dash_mantine_components.getEditor('get-editor-id');\n            if (editor) {\n                const text = editor.getText();\n                const chars = text.length;\n                const words = text.split(/\\\\s+/).filter(Boolean).length;\n                return `Characters: ${chars} | Words: ${words}`;\n            }\n        }\n        return dash_clientside.no_update;\n    }\n    \"\"\",\n    Output(\"stats\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"btn-rte-stats\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\n```\n### Debounce\n\nThe `debounce` prop controls how updates to the `html`, `json`, and `selected` props are triggered in the `RichTextEditor`.\n\nEnabling debounce helps prevent excessive callbacks by delaying updates until the user stops interacting. If set to\n`True`, updates occur only when the editor loses focus. Alternatively, you can specify a delay in milliseconds to\nfine-tune when updates should be sent.\n\n```python\ndmc.RichTextEditor(       \n     debounce=500   # # Delay updates by 500ms \n)\n```\n\n### Persistence\n\nDash provides built-in persistence props that allow components to retain their values across page reloads or app\nsessions. In `RichTextEditor`, this means the editor content can be saved and restored automatically.  \n\nThe following persistence-related props are available:  \n- `persistence` – Enables persistence (`True`, `\"local\"`, `\"session\"`, or `\"memory\"`).  \n- `persisted_props` – Specifies which props should be persisted.  By default it's  `[\"html, json\"]` \n- `persistence_type` – Defines where the data is stored (`\"local\"`, `\"session\"`, or `\"memory\"`).  \n\nFor more details on how Dash handles persistence, refer to the [Dash persistence documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/persistence).\n\n\nNotes:\n - The component must have an `id` for persistence to work.\n - If you want to set an initial value while also enabling persistence, set `persisted_props` to only the prop used for the initial value.\nFor example `persisted_props=['html']`.\n\n\n\n### CSS Extensions\n\nAs of DMC 1.2.0, RichTextEditor component styles are bundled automatically, so you no longer need to include a separate CSS file.\nIf you're using an older version of DMC, refer to the [migration guide](/migration) for instructions on including optional stylesheets.\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n#### RichTextEditor Selectors\n\n| Selector                         | Static Selector                                         | Description |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| `root`                           | `.mantine-RichTextEditor-root`                        | Root element |\n| `toolbar`                        | `.mantine-RichTextEditor-toolbar`                     | Toolbar element |\n| `content`                        | `.mantine-RichTextEditor-content`                     | Content area |\n| `typographyStylesProvider`       | `.mantine-RichTextEditor-typographyStylesProvider`    | TypographyStylesProvider component, wraps content |\n| `control`                        | `.mantine-RichTextEditor-control`                     | `RichTextEditor.Control` root element, used as a base for all controls |\n| `controlIcon`                    | `.mantine-RichTextEditor-controlIcon`                 | Control icon element |\n| `controlsGroup`                  | `.mantine-RichTextEditor-controlsGroup`               | `RichTextEditor.ControlsGroup` component root |\n| `linkEditor`                     | `.mantine-RichTextEditor-linkEditor`                  | Link editor root element |\n| `linkEditorSave`                 | `.mantine-RichTextEditor-linkEditorSave`              | Link editor save button |\n| `linkEditorInput`                | `.mantine-RichTextEditor-linkEditorInput`             | Link editor URL input |\n| `linkEditorExternalControl`      | `.mantine-RichTextEditor-linkEditorExternalControl`   | Link editor external button |\n| `linkEditorDropdown`             | `.mantine-RichTextEditor-linkEditorDropdown`          | Link editor popover dropdown element |\n\n#### RichTextEditor Data Attributes\n\n| Selector  | Attribute     | Condition                 |\n|-----------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| `control` | `data-active` | Control is active        |\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### RichTextEditor\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

To disable a SegmentedControl item, use the array of objects data format and set `disabled = True` on the item that you want to disable. \n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.Text(\"Disabled control\"),\n        dmc.SegmentedControl(\n            disabled=True,\n            data=[\n                {\"value\": \"preview\", \"label\": \"Preview\"},\n                {\"value\": \"code\", \"label\": \"Code\"},\n                {\"value\": \"export\", \"label\": \"Export\"},\n            ],\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(\"Disabled option\"),\n        dmc.SegmentedControl(\n            data=[\n                {\"value\": \"preview\", \"label\": \"Preview\", \"disabled\": True},\n                {\"value\": \"code\", \"label\": \"Code\"},\n                {\"value\": \"export\", \"label\": \"Export\"},\n            ],\n        ),\n    ],\n    align=\"flex-start\",\n)\n```\n### Full Width and Orientation\n\nBy default, SegmentedControl will take only the amount of space that is required to render elements. Set `fullWidth` \nprop to make it block and take 100% width of its container. The orientation can be set via `orientation` prop.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.SegmentedControl(\n    orientation=\"horizontal\",\n    fullWidth=True,\n    data=[]\n)\n```\n\n### Sizes\n\nSegmentedControl supports 5 sizes: xs, sm, md, lg, xl. Size controls font-size and padding properties.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\"Dash\", \"Mantine\", \"Bootstrap\", \"Core\"]\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [dmc.SegmentedControl(data=data, size=x) for x in [\"xs\", \"sm\", \"md\", \"lg\", \"xl\"]],\n    align=\"flex-start\",\n)\n```\n### Radius\n\nxs, sm, md, lg, xl radius values are defined in theme.radius. Alternatively, you can use a number to set radius in px.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\"Dash\", \"Mantine\", \"Bootstrap\", \"Core\"]\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [dmc.SegmentedControl(data=data, radius=x) for x in [0, \"md\", \"lg\", 20]],\n    align=\"flex-start\",\n)\n```\n### Color\n\nBy default, SegmentedControl uses theme.white with shadow in light color scheme and theme.colors.dark[6] background \ncolor for active element. You can choose any color defined in theme.colors in case you need colored variant.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.SegmentedControl(\n    color=\"red\",\n    data = []\n)\n```\n\n### Transitions\nChange transition properties with:\n\n- `transitionDuration` – all transitions duration in ms (ignored if user prefers to reduce motion)\n- `transitionTimingFunction` – defaults to `theme.transitionTimingFunction`\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndata = [\"Dash\", \"Mantine\", \"Bootstrap\", \"Core\"]\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.Text(\"No transition\"),\n        dmc.SegmentedControl(data=data, transitionDuration=0),\n        dmc.Text(\"500ms linear transition\"),\n        dmc.SegmentedControl(\n            data=data, transitionDuration=500, transitionTimingFunction=\"linear\"\n        ),\n    ],\n    align=\"flex-start\",\n)\n```\n### Components in label\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, html, callback\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ndata = [\n    [\"Preview\", \"tabler:eye\"],\n    [\"Code\", \"tabler:code\"],\n    [\"Export\", \"tabler:external-link\"],\n]\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.SegmentedControl(\n            id=\"segmented-with-react-nodes\",\n            value=\"Preview\",\n            data=[\n                {\n                    \"value\": v,\n                    \"label\": dmc.Center(\n                        [DashIconify(icon=icon, width=16), html.Span(v)],\n                        style={\"gap\": 10},\n                    ),\n                }\n                for v, icon in data\n            ],\n            mb=10,\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"segmented--value-data\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"segmented--value-data\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"segmented-with-react-nodes\", \"value\"),\n)\ndef update_value(value):\n    return value\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element.

    "content": "\n\n## Slider  \nUse Slider component to capture user feedback from a range of values.  \nCategory: Inputs  \n\n### Introduction\n\n### Simple Usage\n\nUse the `value` prop to get the value of the slider.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, html, Output, Input\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Slider(\n            id=\"slider-callback\",\n            value=26,\n            marks=[\n                {\"value\": 20, \"label\": \"20%\"},\n                {\"value\": 50, \"label\": \"50%\"},\n                {\"value\": 80, \"label\": \"80%\"},\n            ],\n            mb=35,\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"slider-output\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"slider-output\", \"children\"), Input(\"slider-callback\", \"value\"))\ndef update_value(value):\n    return f\"You have selected: {value}\"\n```\n### Range Slider\n\nNote: The `RangeSlider` has a `minRange` prop that defaults to 10. Make sure `minRange` is not greater than the\nslider's maximum value, or the slider won't work properly.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, html, Output, Input\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.RangeSlider(\n            id=\"range-slider-callback\",\n            value=[26, 50],\n            marks=[\n                {\"value\": 20, \"label\": \"20%\"},\n                {\"value\": 50, \"label\": \"50%\"},\n                {\"value\": 80, \"label\": \"80%\"},\n            ],\n            mb=35,\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"range-slider-output\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"range-slider-output\", \"children\"), Input(\"range-slider-callback\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update_value(value):\n    return f\"You have selected: [{value[0]}, {value[1]}]\"\n```\n### minRange\n\nUse `minRange` prop to control minimum range between from and to values in `RangeSlider`. The default value is 10.\nThe example below shows how to use `minRange` prop to capture decimal values from the user:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.RangeSlider(\n    minRange=0.2, min=0, max=1, step=0.0005, value=[0.1245, 0.5535]\n)\n```\n### Update Mode\n\nBy default, slider value is updated once the user has stopped dragging the handle. But it can be changed by changing\nthe `updatemode` to \"drag\" instead of \"mouseup\" (default).\n\nBelow is a slider with `updatemode` set to \"drag\", observe how the output text changes as you drag the slider handle.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, html, Output, Input\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Slider(\n            id=\"drag-slider\",\n            value=26,\n            updatemode=\"drag\",\n            marks=[\n                {\"value\": 20, \"label\": \"20%\"},\n                {\"value\": 50, \"label\": \"50%\"},\n                {\"value\": 80, \"label\": \"80%\"},\n            ],\n        ),\n        dmc.Space(h=35),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"drag-output\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"drag-output\", \"children\"), Input(\"drag-slider\", \"value\"))\ndef update_value(value):\n    return f\"You have selected: {value}\"\n```\n### Control label\nTo change label behavior and appearance, set the following props:\n\n\n- `label` – set to `None` to disable the label. You can also provide a formatter function (via `{\"function\": \"...\"}`) to customize the label text. The function receives the `value` as its argument.\n- `labelAlwaysOn` – if `True` – label will always be displayed, by default label is visible only when user is dragging\n- `labelTransitionProps` – props passed down to the `Transition` component, can be used to customize label animation\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.Text(\"No label\", size=\"sm\"),\n    dmc.Slider(value=40, label=None),\n\n    dmc.Text(\"Label formatted with a function\", size=\"sm\", mt=\"xl\"),\n    dmc.Slider(\n        value=40,\n        label={\"function\": \"celsiusLabel\"}\n    ),\n\n    dmc.Text(\"Label always visible\", size=\"sm\", mt=\"xl\"),\n    dmc.Slider(value=40, labelAlwaysOn=True),\n\n    dmc.Text(\"Custom label transition\", size=\"sm\", mt=\"xl\"),\n    dmc.Slider(\n        value=40,\n        labelTransitionProps={\n            \"transition\": \"skew-down\",\n            \"duration\": 150,\n            \"timingFunction\": \"linear\"\n        }\n    ),\n])\n```\n\n```javascript\n\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.celsiusLabel = (value) => `${value} °C`;\n```\n\n\n### Min, Max, and Step\n\nYou can set `min`, `max` and `step` values for `Slider` component. This will work even for negative and decimal values.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Slider(min=-10, max=10, step=0.5)\n```\nThe following example uses a function to format the `label`\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder.

By default, `pushOnOverlap`\nis `True`, if you want to disable this behavior, set it to `False`.\n\nExample of `pushOnOverlap=False`:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.RangeSlider(\n    pushOnOverlap=False,\n    minRange=20,\n    value=[25, 65]\n)\n```\n### Marks\n\nAdd any number of marks to the Slider by setting `marks` prop to an array of objects.\n\n```python\nmarks = [\n  { \"value\": 20 },                          # displays mark on slider track\n  { \"value\": 40, \"label\": '40%' },          # adds mark label below slider track\n]\n```\n\n### Restrict selection to marks\nSetting `restrictToMarks=True` ensures that users can only select values matching the specific marks defined. This \nfeature is especially helpful when you have uneven or non-standard marks and want to ensure users can only pick \nfrom those specific points.\n\nNote: The `step` prop is ignored when `restrictToMarks=True`.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        # Slider\n        dmc.Slider(\n            restrictToMarks=True,\n            value=25,\n            marks=[{\"value\": index * 25} for index in range(5)],\n        ),\n        # RangeSlider\n        dmc.RangeSlider(\n            restrictToMarks=True,\n            value=[5, 15],\n            marks=[\n                {\"value\": 5},\n                {\"value\": 15},\n                {\"value\": 25},\n                {\"value\": 35},\n                {\"value\": 70},\n                {\"value\": 80},\n                {\"value\": 90},\n            ],\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Disabled\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.Slider(value=60, disabled=True),\n        dmc.RangeSlider(\n            mt=\"xl\",\n            mb=\"xl\",\n            value=[25, 75],\n            disabled=True,\n            marks=[\n                {\"value\": 0, \"label\": \"xs\"},\n                {\"value\": 25, \"label\": \"sm\"},\n                {\"value\": 50, \"label\": \"md\"},\n                {\"value\": 75, \"label\": \"lg\"},\n                {\"value\": 100, \"label\": \"xl\"},\n            ],\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Thumb size\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.Text(\"Standard size\", size=\"sm\"),\n        dmc.Slider(value=40, label=None),\n        dmc.Text(\"Thumb size number\", size=\"sm\", mt=\"xl\"),\n        dmc.Slider(value=40, thumbSize=50),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Thumb children\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = [\n    dmc.Slider(\n        thumbChildren=DashIconify(icon=\"mdi:heart\", width=16),\n        color=\"red\",\n        label=None,\n        value=40,\n        thumbSize=26,\n        styles={\"thumb\": {\"borderWidth\": 2, \"padding\": 3}},\n    ),\n    dmc.RangeSlider(\n        mt=\"xl\",\n        styles={\"thumb\": {\"borderWidth\": 2, \"padding\": 3}},\n        color=\"red\",\n        label=None,\n        value=[20, 60],\n        thumbSize=26,\n        thumbChildren=[\n            DashIconify(icon=\"mdi:heart\", width=16),\n            DashIconify(icon=\"mdi:heart-broken\", width=16),\n        ],\n    ),\n]\n```\n### Scale\nYou can use the scale prop to represent the value on a different scale.\n\nIn the following demo, the value x represents the value 2^x. Increasing x by one increases the represented value by 2 to the power of x.\n\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n\n### Inverted\nYou can invert the track by setting `inverted=True`:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.Slider(inverted=True, value=80),\n        dmc.RangeSlider(inverted=True, value=[40, 60], mt=\"xl\"),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Dash 4 Slider and RangeSlider\n\nThe Dash 4 [`dcc.Slider`](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components/slider) and `dcc.RangeSlider` components supports \nsome features that are not available in DMC, for example integrated numeric input fields and vertical sliders. To style\nthe `dcc.Slider` with a Mantine theme see the   [Dash 4 components](/dash4-components) section.\n\n### Styling the Slider\n\nThe `Slider` component can be fully customized using Mantine's Styles API. Each element of the `Slider` - from the\nthumb to the track markers - has its own unique selector that can be styled independently.\n\nTry the [interactive example](https://mantine.dev/core/slider/#styles-api) in the upstream Mantine documentation to see\nhow these selectors correspond to different parts of the Slider component. Below, you'll find a comprehensive reference\nof all available selectors, CSS variables, and data attributes.\n\nHere is an example:\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Slider(\n    value=79,\n    marks=[\n        {\"value\": 20, \"label\": \"20%\"},\n        {\"value\": 50, \"label\": \"50%\"},\n        {\"value\": 80, \"label\": \"80%\"},\n    ],\n    size=2,\n    classNames={\n        \"track\": \"dmc-slider-track\",\n        \"mark\": \"dmc-slider-mark\",\n        \"markLabel\": \"dmc-slider-markLabel\",\n        \"thumb\": \"dmc-slider-thumb\",\n    },\n)\n```\n\n```css\n\n.dmc-slider-track {\n  &::before {\n    background-color: light-dark(var(--mantine-color-blue-1), var(--mantine-color-dark-3));\n  }\n}\n\n.dmc-slider-mark {\n  width: 6px;\n  height: 6px;\n  border-radius: 6px;\n  transform: translateX(-3px) translateY(-2px);\n  border-color: light-dark(var(--mantine-color-blue-1), var(--mantine-color-dark-3));\n\n  &[data-filled] {\n    border-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-6);\n  }\n}\n\n.dmc-slider-markLabel {\n  font-size: var(--mantine-font-size-sm);\n  color: var(--mantine-color-green-5);\n  margin-bottom: 5px;\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n\n.dmc-slider-thumb {\n  height: 16px;\n  width: 16px;\n  background-color: var(--mantine-color-green-5);\n  border-width: 1px;\n  box-shadow: var(--mantine-shadow-lg);\n}\n```\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element.

It can be used to implement a common Header - Navbar - Footer - Aside layout pattern.\nAll AppShell components have `position: fixed` style - they are not scrolled with the page.\n\nThe documentation app that you are viewing uses AppShell with Header, Aside, and Navbar.\n\nThis is the code for the first example above for the basic app shell with header and navbar.  The navbar collapses on mobile.\n\n```python\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Dash, Input, Output, State, callback\n\napp = Dash()\n\nlogo = \"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1ff143b-4365-4fd1-880f-3e97aab5c302\"\n\nlayout = dmc.AppShell(\n    [\n        dmc.AppShellHeader(\n            dmc.Group(\n                [\n                    dmc.Burger(id=\"burger\", size=\"sm\", hiddenFrom=\"sm\", opened=False),\n                    dmc.Image(src=logo, h=40),\n                    dmc.Title(\"Demo App\", c=\"blue\"),\n                ],\n                h=\"100%\",\n                px=\"md\",\n            )\n        ),\n        dmc.AppShellNavbar(\n            id=\"navbar\",\n            children=[\n                \"Navbar\",\n                *[dmc.Skeleton(height=28, mt=\"sm\", animate=False) for _ in range(15)],\n            ],\n            p=\"md\",\n        ),\n        dmc.AppShellMain(\"Main\"),\n    ],\n    header={\"height\": 60},\n    padding=\"md\",\n    navbar={\n        \"width\": 300,\n        \"breakpoint\": \"sm\",\n        \"collapsed\": {\"mobile\": True},\n    },\n    id=\"appshell\",\n)\n\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(layout)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"appshell\", \"navbar\"),\n    Input(\"burger\", \"opened\"),\n    State(\"appshell\", \"navbar\"),\n)\ndef navbar_is_open(opened, navbar):\n    navbar[\"collapsed\"] = {\"mobile\": not opened}\n    return navbar\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n\n```\n\n### AppShell components\n\n* `AppShell` - root component, it is required to wrap all other components, used to configure layout properties\n* `AppShellHeader` - section rendered at the top of the page\n* `AppShellNavbar` - section rendered on the left side of the page\n* `AppShellAside` - section rendered on the right side of the page\n* `AppShellFooter` - section rendered at the bottom of the page\n* `AppShellMain` - main section rendered at the center of the page, has static position, all other sections are offset by its padding\n* `AppShellSection` - utility component that can be used to render group of content inside `AppShellNavbar` and `AppShellAside`\n\n### AppShell Configuration\n`AppShell` component accepts, `header`, `footer`, `navbar` and `aside` props to configure corresponding sections. It is \nrequired to set these props if you want to use corresponding components. For example, if you want to use `AppShellHeader`\ncomponent, you need to set `header` prop on the `AppShell` component.\n\n### header and footer properties\n\n`header` and `footer` configuration dictionaries are the same and have the following properties:\n\n- `height`: Height of the section: number, string or dict  with breakpoints as keys and height as value\n- `collapsed`: boolean; If section is collapsed it is hidden from the viewport and is not offset in `AppShellMain`\n- `offset`: boolean; Determines whether the section should be offset by the `AppShellMain`. For example, it is useful if you want to hide header based on the scroll position.\n\n### navbar and aside properties\n\n`navbar` and `aside` configuration dictionaries are the same as well and have the following properties:\n\n- `width`: Width of the section: number, string or dict with breakpoints as keys and width as value \n- `breakpoint`: Breakpoint at which section should switch to mobile mode. In mobile mode the section always has \n100% width and its collapsed state is controlled by the `collapsed.mobile` instead of `collapsed.desktop` \n- `collapsed`: Determines whether the section should be collapsed.  Example:  {\"desktop\": False; \"mobile\": True };\n\n### layout prop\n`layout` prop controls how `AppShellHeader` / `AppShellFooter` and `AppShellNavbar` / `AppShellAside` are positioned \nrelative to each other. It accepts `alt` and `default` values:\n\n- `alt` – `AppShellNavbar`/`AppShellAside` height is equal to viewport height, `AppShellHeader`/`AppShellFooter` width \nis equal to viewport width less the `AppShellNavbar` and `AppShellAside` width.  See example #7 above.\n\n- `default` – `AppShellNavbar`/`AppShellAside` height is equal to viewport height - `AppShellHeader`/ `AppShellFooter` \nheight, `AppShellHeader`/`AppShellFooter` width is equal to viewport width \n\n### height prop\n`height` property in `header` and `footer` configuration dicts works the following way:\n\n- If you pass a number, the value will be converted to rem and used as height at all viewport sizes.\n- To change height based on viewport width, use dict with breakpoints as keys and height as values. It works the same way as `style` props.\n\nExamples:\n```python\n# Height is a number, it will be converted to rem  and used as height at all viewport sizes\ndmc.AppShell(\n    children=[\n        dmc.AppShellHeader(\"Header\")\n        # ...\n     ],\n    header={\"height\": 48}    \n)\n```\n\n```python\n\n# Height is an dict with breakpoints:\n# - height is 48 when viewport width is < theme.breakpoints.sm\n# - height is 60 when viewport width is >= theme.breakpoints.sm and < theme.breakpoints.lg\n# - height is 76 when viewport width is >= theme.breakpoints.lg\ndmc.AppShell(\n    children=[\n       dmc.AppShellHeader(\"Header\")\n    ],\n    header={\"height\": {\"base\": 48, \"sm\": 60, \"lg\": 76}}    \n)\n```\n\n### Width configuration\n`width` property in `navbar` and `aside`  configuration dictionaries works the following way:\n\n- If you pass a number, the value will be converted to rem and used as width when the viewport is larger than breakpoint.\n- To change `width` based on viewport width, use dict with breakpoints as keys and width as values. It works the same way as `style` props. Note that width is always 100% when the viewport is smaller than breakpoint.\n\nExamples\n\n```python\n# Width is a number, it will be converted to rem and used as width when viewport is larger than theme.breakpoints.sm\ndmc.AppShell(\n    children=[\n        dmc.AppShellNavbar(\"Navbar\")\n        # ...\n     ],\n    navbar={\"width\": 48, \"breakpoint\": \"sm\"}    \n)\n```\n\n```python\n\n# Width is an object with breakpoints:\n# - width is 100% when viewport width is < theme.breakpoints.sm\n# - width is 200 when viewport width is >= theme.breakpoints.sm and < theme.breakpoints.lg\n# - width is 300 when viewport width is >= theme.breakpoints.lg\ndmc.AppShell(\n    children=[\n        dmc.AppShellNavbar(\"Navbar\")\n        # ...\n     ],\n    navbar={\"width\": {\"sm\": 200, \"lg\": 300 }, \"breakpoint\": 'sm' } \n)\n```\n\n### padding prop\n`padding` prop controls the padding of the `AppShellMain` component. It is important to use it instead of setting padding\non the `AppShellMain` directly because padding of the `AppShellMain` is also used to offset `AppShellHeader`, `AppShellNavbar`, `AppShellAside` and `AppShellFooter` components.\n\n`padding` prop works the same way as `style` props and accepts numbers, strings and dicts with breakpoints as keys and padding as values. You can reference theme.spacing values or use any valid CSS values.\n\n```python\n# Padding is always theme.spacing.md\ndmc.AppShell(\n   # content\n   padding=\"md\"\n)\n```\n\n\n```python\n\n# Padding is:\n# - 10 when viewport width is < theme.breakpoints.sm\n# - 15 when viewport width is >= theme.breakpoints.sm and < theme.breakpoints.lg\n# - theme.spacing.xl when viewport width is >= theme.breakpoints.lg\ndmc.AppShell(\n   # content\n   padding={\"base\": 10, \"sm\": 15, \"lg\": \"xl\" }\n)\n```\n### Collapsed navbar/aside configuration\n`navbar` and `aside` props have `collapsed` property. The property accepts an dict { mobile: boolean; desktop: boolean } which\nallows to configure collapsed state depending on the viewport width.\n\nSee example #4 above: Collapsible Navbar on Desktop and Mobile\n\n### withBorder prop\n`withBorder` prop is available on `AppShell` and associated sections: `AppShellHeader`, `AppShellNavbar`, `AppShellAside`\nand `AppShellFooter`. By default, `withBorder` prop is True – all components have a border on the side that is adjacent \nto the `AppShellMain` component. For example, `AppShellHeader` is located at the top of the page – it has a border on the\nbottom side, `AppShellNavbar` is located on the left side of the page – it has a border on the right side.\n\nTo remove the border from all components, set `withBorder=False` on the `AppShell`:\n\n```python\ndmc.AppShell(withBorder=False)\n```\n\nTo remove the border from a specific component, set `withBorder=False` on that component:\n\n```python\ndmc.AppShell(\n   children=[\n      dmc.AppShellHeader(withBorder=False)\n   ]\n)\n```\n\n\n\n### zIndex prop\n\n`zIndex` prop is available on AppShell and associated sections: `AppShellHeader`, `AppShellNavbar`, `AppShellAside` and `AppShellFooter`.\n\nBy default, all sections z-index is 200.\n\nTo change z-index of all sections, set `zIndex` prop on the AppShell:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.AppShell(\n    zIndex=100,\n    children=[\n        # content\n    ]\n)\n```\n\nTo change z-index of individual sections, set `zIndex` prop on each of them:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.AppShell(\n    children=[\n        dmc.AppShellHeader(\"Header\", zIndex=2000),\n        dmc.AppShellNavbar(\"Navbar\", zIndex=2000),\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n### Control transitions\nSet `transitionDuration` and `transitionTimingFunction` props on the `AppShell` to control transitions:\n\n```python\ndmc.AppShell(\n   transitionDuration=500,\n   transitionTimingFunction=\"ease\"   ,\n)\n```\n\n### disabled prop\nSet `disabled` prop on the `AppShell` to prevent all sections except `AppShellMain` from rendering. It is useful when \nyou want to hide the shell on some pages of your application.\n\n```python\ndmc.AppShell(disabled=True)\n```\n\n\n### Usage in docs\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.AppShell(\n    [\n        dmc.AppShellHeader(\"Header\", px=25),\n        dmc.AppShellNavbar(\"Navbar\"),\n        dmc.AppShellAside(\"Aside\", withBorder=False),\n        dmc.AppShellMain(children=[...]),\n    ],\n    header={\"height\": 70},\n    padding=\"xl\",    \n    navbar={\n        \"width\": 300,\n        \"breakpoint\": \"sm\",\n        \"collapsed\": {\"mobile\": True},\n    },\n    aside={\n        \"width\": 300,\n        \"breakpoint\": \"xl\",\n        \"collapsed\": {\"desktop\": False, \"mobile\": True},\n    },\n)\n```\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element.

    "content": "\n\n## Grid  \nResponsive 12 columns grid system  \nCategory: Layout  \n\n### Usage\n\nUse Grid component to create layouts with a flexbox grid system.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nstyle = {\n    \"border\": f\"1px solid var(--mantine-primary-color-filled)\",\n    \"textAlign\": \"center\",\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.Grid(\n    children=[\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"1\", style=style), span=6),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"2\", style=style), span=3),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"3\", style=style), span=3),\n    ],\n    gutter=\"xl\",\n)\n```\n### Columns span\n`The GridCol` `span` prop controls the ratio of column width to the total width of the row. By default, grid uses \n12 columns layout, so `span` prop can be any number from 1 to 12.\n\nExamples:\n```python\ndmc.GridCol(span=3)  # 3 / 12 = 25% of row width\ndmc.GridCol(span=4)  # 4 / 12 = 33% of row width\ndmc.GridCol(span=6)  # 6 / 12 = 50% of row width\ndmc.GridCol(span=12) # 12 / 12 = 100% of row width\n```\n`span` prop also supports dictionary syntax to change column width based on viewport width, it accepts `xs`, `sm`, `md`,\n`lg` and `xl` keys and values from 1 to 12. The syntax is the same as in `style` props.\n\nIn the following example `span={'base': 12, 'md': 6, 'lg': 3`}:\n\n- `base` – 12 / 12 = 100% of row width when viewport width is less than `md` breakpoint\n- `md` – 6 / 12 = 50% of row width when viewport width is between md and `lg` breakpoints\n- `lg` – 3 / 12 = 25% of row width when viewport width is greater than `lg` breakpoint\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nstyle = {\n    \"border\": f\"1px solid var(--mantine-primary-color-filled)\",\n    \"textAlign\": \"center\",\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.Grid(\n    children=[\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"1\", style=style), span={\"base\": 12, \"md\": 6, \"lg\":3}),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"2\", style=style), span={\"base\": 12, \"md\": 6, \"lg\":3}),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"3\", style=style), span={\"base\": 12, \"md\": 6, \"lg\":3}),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"4\", style=style), span={\"base\": 12, \"md\": 6, \"lg\":3}),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Gutter \n\nSet `gutter` prop to control spacing between columns. The prop works the same way as `style` props – you can reference\ntheme.spacing values with `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg` and `xl` strings and use dictionary syntax to change gutter based on\nviewport width.  You can also set gutter to a number to set spacing in px.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nstyle = {\n    \"border\": f\"1px solid var(--mantine-primary-color-filled)\",\n    \"textAlign\": \"center\",\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.Grid(\n    children=[\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"1\", style=style), span=4),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"2\", style=style), span=4),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"3\", style=style), span=4),\n    ],\n    gutter={ \"base\": 5, \"xs\": \"md\", \"md\": \"xl\", \"xl\": 50 },\n)\n```\n### Grow\n\nSet `grow` prop on Grid to force last row to take 100% of container width.\n\n### Column Offset\n\nSet `offset` prop on `GridCol` component to add gaps to the grid. `offset` prop supports the same syntax as span\nprop: a number from 1 to 12 or a dictionary with `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg` and `xl` keys and values from 1 to 12.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nstyle = {\n    \"border\": f\"1px solid var(--mantine-primary-color-filled)\",\n    \"textAlign\": \"center\",\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.Grid(\n    children=[\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"1\", style=style), span=3),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"2\", style=style), span=3),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"3\", style=style), span=3, offset=3),\n    ],\n    gutter=\"xl\",\n)\n```\n### Order\nSet the `order` prop on `GridCol` component to change the order of columns. `order` prop supports the same syntax as\n`span` prop: a number from 1 to 12 or a dictionary with `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg` and `xl` keys and values from 1 to 12.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nstyle = {\n    \"border\": f\"1px solid var(--mantine-primary-color-filled)\",\n    \"textAlign\": \"center\",\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.Grid(\n    children=[\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"2\", style=style), span=3, order={\"base\": 2, \"sm\": 1, \"lg\": 3}),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"3\", style=style), span=3, order={\"base\": 3, \"sm\": 2, \"lg\": 2}),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"1\", style=style), span=3, order={\"base\": 1, \"sm\": 3, \"lg\": 1}),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Multiple rows\n\nOnce children columns span and offset sum exceeds `columns` prop (defaults to 12), columns are placed on next row.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nstyle = {\n    \"border\": f\"1px solid var(--mantine-primary-color-filled)\",\n    \"textAlign\": \"center\",\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.Grid(\n    children=[\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"1\", style=style), span=4),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"2\", style=style), span=4),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"3\", style=style), span=4),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"4\", style=style), span=4),\n    ],\n    gutter=\"xl\",\n)\n```\n### Justify and Align\n\nSince grid is a flexbox container, you can control justify-content and align-items properties by using `justify` and \n`align` props respectively. Note the minimum height set on column 2 and 3.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Grid(\n    children=[\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"1\"), span=4),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"2\", style={\"minHeight\":80}), span=4),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"3\", style={\"minHeight\":120}), span=4),\n    ],\n    justify=\"center\",\n    align=\"stretch\",\n\n)\n```\n\n### Auto Sized Columns\n\nAll columns in a row with `span` or a `breakpoint` of `auto` will have equal size, growing as much as they can to fill the row.\nIn this example, the second column takes up 50% of the row while the other two columns automatically resize to fill the remaining space.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nstyle = {\n    \"border\": f\"1px solid var(--mantine-primary-color-filled)\",\n    \"textAlign\": \"center\",\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.Grid(\n    children=[\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"span=auto\", style=style), span=\"auto\"),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"span=6\", style=style), span=6),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"span=auto\", style=style), span=\"auto\"),\n    ],\n    gutter=\"xl\",\n)\n```\n### Fit Content\n\nIf you set `span` or a `breakpoint` to `content`, the column's size will automatically adjust to match the width of its content.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nstyle = {\n    \"border\": f\"1px solid var(--mantine-primary-color-filled)\",\n    \"textAlign\": \"center\",\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.Grid(\n    children=[\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"content width\", style=style), span=\"content\"),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"2\", style=style), span=6),\n    ],\n    gutter=\"xl\",\n)\n```\n### Change columns count\nBy default, grids uses 12 columns layout, you can change it by setting `columns` prop on `Grid` component. Note that\nin this case, columns span and offset will be calculated relative to this value.\n\nIn the following example, first column takes 50% with 12 span (12/24), second and third take 25% (6/24):\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nstyle = {\n    \"border\": f\"1px solid var(--mantine-primary-color-filled)\",\n    \"textAlign\": \"center\",\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.Grid(\n    children=[\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"1\", style=style), span=12),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"2\", style=style), span=6),\n        dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"3\", style=style), span=6),\n    ],\n    columns=24\n)\n```\n### Container queries\nTo use [container queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries) instead \nof media queries, set `type='container'`. With container queries, all responsive values are adjusted based on the\ncontainer width, not the viewport width.\n\nNote that, when using container queries, it is also required to set `breakpoints` prop to the exact container width values.\n\nTo see how the grid changes, resize the root element of the demo with the resize handle located at the bottom right\ncorner of the demo:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nstyle = {\n    \"border\": f\"1px solid var(--mantine-primary-color-filled)\",\n    \"textAlign\": \"center\",\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box(\n    # Wrapper div is added for demonstration purposes only,\n    # it is not required in real projects\n    dmc.Grid(\n        children=[\n            dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"1\", style=style), span={\"base\": 12, \"md\": 6, \"lg\": 3}),\n            dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"2\", style=style), span={\"base\": 12, \"md\": 6, \"lg\": 3}),\n            dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"3\", style=style), span={\"base\": 12, \"md\": 6, \"lg\": 3}),\n            dmc.GridCol(dmc.Box(\"4\", style=style), span={\"base\": 12, \"md\": 6, \"lg\": 3}),\n        ],\n        gutter=\"xl\",\n        type=\"container\",\n        breakpoints={\n            \"xs\": \"100px\",\n            \"sm\": \"200px\",\n            \"md\": \"300px\",\n            \"lg\": \"400px\",\n            \"xl\": \"500px\",\n        },\n    ),\n    style={\"resize\": 'horizontal', \"overflow\": 'hidden', \"maxWidth\": '100%', \"margin\": 24 },\n)\n```\n### overflow: hidden\nBy default, `Grid` has `overflow: visible` style on the root element. In some cases you might want to change it to\n`overflow: hidden` to prevent negative margins from overflowing the grid container. For example, if you use `Grid` \nwithout parent container which has padding.\n\n```python\ndmc.Grid([\n    dmc.GridCol(\"1\", span=6),\n    dmc.GridCol(\"2\", span=6),\n], overflow=\"hidden\")\n```\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element.

To change this behavior, set `preventGrowOverflow` to False and \nchildren will be allowed to grow and take as much space as they need.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box(\n    style={\"overflow\": \"hidden\"},\n    children=[\n        dmc.Box(\n            maw=500,\n            p=\"md\",\n            mx=\"auto\",\n            bg=\"var(--mantine-color-blue-light)\",\n            children=[\n                dmc.Text(\n                    size=\"sm\",\n                    mb=5,\n                    children=(\n                        \"preventGrowOverflow: true – each child width is always limited \"\n                        \"to 33% of parent width (since there are 3 children)\"\n                    ),\n                ),\n                dmc.Group(\n                    grow=True,\n                    wrap=\"nowrap\",\n                    children=[\n                        dmc.Button(\"First button\", variant=\"default\"),\n                        dmc.Button(\"Second button with large content\", variant=\"default\"),\n                        dmc.Button(\"Third button\", variant=\"default\"),\n                    ],\n                ),\n                dmc.Text(\n                    size=\"sm\",\n                    mb=5,\n                    mt=\"md\",\n                    children=(\n                        \"preventGrowOverflow: false – children will grow based on their \"\n                        \"content, they can take more than 33% of parent width\"\n                    ),\n                ),\n                dmc.Group(\n                    grow=True,\n                    preventGrowOverflow=False,\n                    wrap=\"nowrap\",\n                    children=[\n                        dmc.Button(\"First button\", variant=\"default\"),\n                        dmc.Button(\"Second button with large content\", variant=\"default\"),\n                        dmc.Button(\"Third button\", variant=\"default\"),\n                    ],\n                ),\n            ],\n        )\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Group children\n`Group` works correctly only with components. Strings, or numbers may have incorrect styles if `grow` prop is set:\n\n```python\n# don't do this\ndmc.Group([\n    \"Some text\",\n    dmc.Text(\"Some more text\"),\n    20,\n], grow=True)\n```\n\n### Browser support\n`Group` uses flexbox `gap` to add spacing between children. In older browsers, `Group` children may not have spacing.\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element.

The `cols`, `spacing` and `verticalSpacing` props accepts dictionaries to set responsive values based on viewport width.\n\n\n### Grid\nUse [Grid](/components/grid) if you need columns with different sizes.   You can also set spans, spacing, offsets, and ordering and more.\n\n\n### Group\nUse [Group](/components/group) if you want to put items next to each other horizontally.\n\n### Stack\nUse [Stack](/components/stack) if you want to put items next to each other vertically\n\n\n### Flex\nUse [Flex](/components/flex) if you want to create both horizontal and vertical flexbox layouts. It's more flexible than `Group` and `Stack` but requires more configuration.\n\n\n### AspectRatio\nUse [AspectRatio](/components/aspectratio) to ensure that content always maintains a specific width-to-height ratio,\nno matter the screen size.  Great for images and videos.\n\n\n### Center\nUse [Center](/components/center) component to center content vertically and horizontally.\nThis example centers an icon with a link with the `inline` prop:\n\n\n### Container\nUse [Container](/components/container) to center content horizontally and add horizontal padding from theme. Good for limiting width and centering content on large screens.\n\n\n###  Box\n[Box](/components/box) is like an `html.Div` but also includes Mantine style props.\n\n\n### Paper\n\nUse [Paper](/components/paper) to group content visually like a card.  It includes props for background, padding, shadow, borders, and rounded corners.\n\n\n### AppShell\n\nThe [AppShell](/components/appshell) component is a layout component designed to create responsive and consistent app layouts.\nIt includes:\n- `AppShell` - root component, it is required to wrap all other components, used to configure layout properties\n- `AppShellHeader` - section rendered at the top of the page\n- `AppShellNavbar` - section rendered on the left side of the page\n- `AppShellAside` - section rendered on the right side of the page\n- `AppShellFooter` - section rendered at the bottom of the page\n- `AppShellMain` - main section rendered at the center of the page, has static position, all other sections are offset by its padding\n- `AppShellSection` - utility component that can be used to render group of content inside `AppShellNavbar` and `AppShellAside`\n\nThis DMC documentation app is built using `AppShell` components.\n\nSee the [AppShell](/components/appshell) docs for more info and examples:\n\n"

    "content": "\n\n## SimpleGrid  \nUse SimpleGrid component to create a grid where each column takes equal width. You can use it to create responsive layouts.  \nCategory: Layout  \n\n### Usage\n\n`SimpleGrid` is a responsive grid system with equal-width columns. It uses CSS grid layout. If you need to set different\nwidths for columns, use `Grid` component instead.\n\n### spacing and verticalSpacing props\n`spacing` prop is used both for horizontal and vertical spacing if `verticalSpacing` is not set:\n\n```python\n\n# `spacing` is used for both horizontal and vertical spacing\ndmc.SimpleGrid(spacing=\"xl\")\n\n# `spacing` is used for horizontal spacing, `verticalSpacing` for vertical\ndmc.SimpleGrid(spacing=\"xl\", verticalSpacing=\"lg\")\n```\n\n### Responsive Props\n\n`cols`, `spacing` and `verticalSpacing` props support object notation for responsive values, \nit works the same way as [style props](/style-props): the object may have `base`, `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg` and `xl` key, \nand values from those keys will be applied according to current viewport width.\n\n`cols` prop can be understood from the below example as:\n\n- 1 column if viewport width is less than `sm` breakpoint\n- 2 columns if viewport width is between `sm` and `lg` breakpoints\n- 5 columns if viewport width is greater than `lg` breakpoint\n\nSame logic applies to `spacing` and `verticalSpacing` props.\n\nResize browser to see breakpoints behavior.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\nstyle = {\n    \"border\": f\"1px solid var(--mantine-primary-color-filled)\",\n    \"textAlign\": \"center\",\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.SimpleGrid(\n    cols={\"base\": 1, \"sm\": 2, \"lg\": 5},\n    spacing={\"base\": 10, \"sm\": \"xl\"},\n    verticalSpacing={\"base\": \"md\", \"sm\": \"xl\"},\n    children=[\n        html.Div(\"1\", style=style),\n        html.Div(\"2\", style=style),\n        html.Div(\"3\", style=style),\n        html.Div(\"4\", style=style),\n        html.Div(\"5\", style=style),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Container queries\nTo use [container queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries) instead\nof media queries, set `type='container'`. With container queries, grid columns and spacing will be adjusted based on the\ncontainer width, not the viewport width.\n\nNote that, when using container queries, `cols`, `spacing` and `verticalSpacing` props cannot reference `theme.breakpoints`\nvalues in keys. It is required to use exact `px` or `em` values.\n\nTo see how the grid changes, resize the root element of the demo with the resize handle located at the bottom right\ncorner of the demo:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\nstyle = {\n    \"border\": f\"1px solid var(--mantine-primary-color-filled)\",\n    \"textAlign\": \"center\",\n}\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    # Wrapper div is added for demonstration purposes only,\n    # it is not required in real projects\n    dmc.SimpleGrid(\n        type=\"container\",\n        cols={\"base\": 1, \"300px\": 2, \"500px\": 5},\n        spacing={\"base\": 10, \"300px\": \"xl\"},\n        children=[\n            html.Div(\"1\", style=style),\n            html.Div(\"2\", style=style),\n            html.Div(\"3\", style=style),\n            html.Div(\"4\", style=style),\n            html.Div(\"5\", style=style),\n        ],\n        p=\"xs\",\n    ),\n    style={\"resize\": \"horizontal\", \"overflow\": \"hidden\", \"maxWidth\": \"100%\"},\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

    "content": "\n\n## NavLink  \nA Navlink component.  \nCategory: Navigation  \n\n### Basic usage\n\nUse `NavLink`'s `n_clicks` property in callbacks, or you can set `href` to make it a link.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\n\ndef get_icon(icon):\n    return DashIconify(icon=icon, height=16)\n\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.NavLink(\n            label=\"With icon\",\n            leftSection=get_icon(icon=\"bi:house-door-fill\"),\n        ),\n        dmc.NavLink(\n            label=\"With right section\",\n            leftSection=get_icon(icon=\"tabler:gauge\"),\n            rightSection=get_icon(icon=\"tabler-chevron-right\"),\n        ),\n        dmc.NavLink(\n            label=\"Disabled\",\n            leftSection=get_icon(icon=\"tabler:circle-off\"),\n            disabled=True,\n        ),\n        dmc.NavLink(\n            label=\"With description\",\n            description=\"Additional information\",\n            leftSection=dmc.Badge(\n                \"3\", size=\"xs\", variant=\"filled\", color=\"red\", w=16, h=16, p=0\n            ),\n        ),\n        dmc.NavLink(\n            label=\"Active subtle\",\n            leftSection=get_icon(icon=\"tabler:activity\"),\n            rightSection=get_icon(icon=\"tabler-chevron-right\"),\n            variant=\"subtle\",\n            active=True,\n        ),\n        dmc.NavLink(\n            label=\"Active light\",\n            leftSection=get_icon(icon=\"tabler:activity\"),\n            rightSection=get_icon(icon=\"tabler-chevron-right\"),\n            active=True,\n        ),\n        dmc.NavLink(\n            label=\"Active filled\",\n            leftSection=get_icon(icon=\"tabler:activity\"),\n            rightSection=get_icon(icon=\"tabler-chevron-right\"),\n            variant=\"filled\",\n            active=True,\n        ),\n    ],\n    style={\"width\": 240},\n)\n```\n### Active styles\n\nSet `active` prop to add active styles to `NavLink`. You can customize active styles with `color` and `variant` properties.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ndmc.NavLink(\n    label=\"With right section\",\n    leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:gauge\"),\n    active=True,\n    variant=\"filled\",\n    color=\"orange\",\n    id=\"navlink-interactive\",\n    rightSection=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler-chevron-right\"),\n),\n```\n\n### Setting Active prop based on URL\n\nThe `active` prop in `NavLink` controls whether a link is highlighted as active. It can be set manually (`True`/`False`)\nor automatically based on the current URL.  \n\n*New in dash-mantine-components > = 1.0.0*  \n\nNow, `active` can be set dynamically:  \n- `\"exact\"` → Active when the current pathname matches `href`.  \n- `\"partial\"` → Active when the current pathname starts with `href` (includes subpages).  \n\nExample:\n- User on `/page-1/subject-1` → The second and third links are active (since `\"partial\"` includes subpages).  \n- User on `/page-1` → Only the second link is active.  \n\n\n```python\nhtml.Div([\n    dmc.NavLink(label=\"Home\", href=\"/home\", active=\"exact\"),\n    dmc.NavLink(label=\"Page 1\", href=\"/page-1\", active=\"partial\"),\n    dmc.NavLink(label=\"Subject 1\", href=\"/page-1/subject-1\", active=\"exact\"),\n])\n```\nSee a complete example in Multi-Page App Example with Active Links section.  \n\n\n### Setting active prop in a callback\n\nUse a callback to set `active` prop if you are using dash-mantine-components<1.0.0\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use a callback to set the `active` prop of the `NavLink` when the user navigates to a different page. It uses the \"Dash Pages\" feature but can be adapted to any other page navigation system.\n\n```python\n# Create Navlinks (using dash.page_registry)\n[\n    dmc.NavLink(\n        label=f\"{page['name']}\",\n        href=page[\"relative_path\"],\n        id={\"type\": \"navlink\", \"index\": page[\"relative_path\"]},\n    )\n    for page in page_registry.values()\n]\n\n# ...\n\n# Callback (using the dcc.location provided by Dash Pages)\n@app.callback(Output({\"type\": \"navlink\", \"index\": ALL}, \"active\"), Input(\"_pages_location\", \"pathname\"))\ndef update_navlinks(pathname):\n    return [control[\"id\"][\"index\"] == pathname for control in callback_context.outputs_list]\n\n```\n\n### Nested NavLinks\n\nTo create nested links put dmc.NavLink as children of another dmc.NavLink.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\n\ndef get_icon(icon):\n    return DashIconify(icon=icon, height=16)\n\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    style={\"width\": 240},\n    children=[\n        dmc.NavLink(\n            label=\"First parent link\",\n            leftSection=get_icon(icon=\"tabler:gauge\"),\n            childrenOffset=28,\n            children=[\n                dmc.NavLink(label=\"First child link\"),\n                dmc.NavLink(label=\"Second child link\"),\n                dmc.NavLink(\n                    label=\"Nested parent link\",\n                    childrenOffset=28,\n                    children=[\n                        dmc.NavLink(label=\"First child link\"),\n                        dmc.NavLink(label=\"Second child link\"),\n                        dmc.NavLink(label=\"Third child link\"),\n                    ],\n                ),\n            ],\n        ),\n        dmc.NavLink(\n            label=\"Second parent link\",\n            leftSection=get_icon(icon=\"tabler:fingerprint\"),\n            childrenOffset=28,\n            opened=True,\n            children=[\n                dmc.NavLink(label=\"First child link\"),\n                dmc.NavLink(label=\"Second child link\"),\n                dmc.NavLink(label=\"Third child link\"),\n            ],\n        ),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Multi-Page App Example with Active Links\nHere's a minimal multi-page app example using Pages. It demonstrates how `active=\"exact\"` and `active=\"partial\"`\nautomatically apply active styles based on the current URL\n\n```python\nimport dash\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Dash, html\n\napp = Dash(use_pages=True, pages_folder=\"\")\n\ndash.register_page(\"home\", path=\"/\", layout=html.Div(\"I'm home\"))\ndash.register_page(\"page1\", path=\"/page-1\", layout=html.Div(\"Info about page 1 subjects\"))\ndash.register_page(\"page1s1\", path=\"/page-1/sub-1\", layout=html.Div(\"page 1 subject 1\"))\ndash.register_page(\"page1s2\", path=\"/page-1/sub-2\", layout=html.Div(\"page 1 subject 2\"))\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n    dmc.NavLink(label=\"home\", href=\"/\", active='exact'),\n    dmc.NavLink(\n            label=\"Page 1\",\n            childrenOffset=28,\n            href=\"/page-1\",\n            active='partial',\n            children=[\n                dmc.NavLink(label=\"Subject 1\", href=\"/page-1/sub-1\", active=\"exact\"),\n                dmc.NavLink(label=\"Subject 2\", href=\"/page-1/sub-2\", active=\"exact\"),\n            ],\n    ),\n    dmc.Divider(mb=\"lg\"),\n    dash.page_container\n])\n\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider([component])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n\n```\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n| Name        | Static selector              | Description                                  |\n|:------------|:-----------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|\n| root        | .mantine-NavLink-root        | Root element                                 |\n| body        | .mantine-NavLink-body        | Contains label and description               |\n| section     | .mantine-NavLink-section     | Left and right sections                      |\n| label       | .mantine-NavLink-label       | NavLink label                                |\n| description | .mantine-NavLink-description | Dimmed description displayed below the label |\n| children    | .mantine-NavLink-children    | Wrapper around nested links                  |\n| chevron     | .mantine-NavLink-chevron     | Default chevron icon                         |\n| collapse    | .mantine-NavLink-collapse    | Nested links Collapse container              |\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### NavLink\n\n- children (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):\n    Child `NavLink` components.\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- active (boolean; default False):\n    Controls whether the link is styled as active (default: `False`).\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

Colors can also be set on individual steps.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Stepper(\n    active=1,\n    color=\"green\",\n    radius=\"lg\",\n    size=\"sm\", \n    children=[\n        dmc.StepperStep(label=\"First step\", description=\"Create an account\"),\n        dmc.StepperStep(label=\"Second step\", description=\"Verify email\"),\n    ],\n)\n```\n\nComponent size is controlled by two props: `size` and `iconSize`. `size` prop controls icon size, label and description font size.\n`iconSize` allows to overwrite icon size separately from other size values.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Stepper(\n    active=1,\n    iconSize=42,\n    children=[\n        dmc.StepperStep(label=\"First step\", description=\"Create an account\"),\n        dmc.StepperStep(label=\"Second step\", description=\"Verify email\"),\n    ],\n)\n```\n\n### Loading state\n\nTo indicate loading state set `loading` prop on `Step` component, `Loader` will replace step icon.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Stepper(\n            active=1,\n            children=[\n                dmc.StepperStep(\n                    label=\"First step\",\n                    description=\"Create an account\",\n                    children=dmc.Text(\"Step 1 content: Create an account\", ta=\"center\"),\n                ),\n                dmc.StepperStep(\n                    label=\"Second step\",\n                    description=\"Verify email\",\n                    children=dmc.Text(\"Step 2 content: Verify email\", ta=\"center\"),\n                    loading=True,\n                ),\n                dmc.StepperStep(\n                    label=\"Final step\",\n                    description=\"Get full access\",\n                    children=dmc.Text(\"Step 3 content: Get full access\", ta=\"center\"),\n                ),\n            ],\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Custom icons\n\nYou can replace step icon by setting `icon` prop on Step component. To change completed check icon set `completedIcon` on Stepper component.\nYou can also change completed icon for each step, for example, to indicate error state.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Output, Input, State, ctx\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\nmin_step = 0\nmax_step = 3\nactive = 1\n\n\ndef get_icon(icon):\n    return DashIconify(icon=icon, height=20)\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Container(\n    [\n        dmc.Stepper(\n            id=\"stepper-custom-icons\",\n            active=active,\n            children=[\n                dmc.StepperStep(\n                    label=\"First step\",\n                    description=\"Create an account\",\n                    icon=get_icon(icon=\"material-symbols:account-circle\"),\n                    progressIcon=get_icon(icon=\"material-symbols:account-circle\"),\n                    completedIcon=get_icon(icon=\"mdi:account-check\"),\n                    children=[\n                        dmc.Text(\"Step 1 content: Create an account\", ta=\"center\")\n                    ],\n                ),\n                dmc.StepperStep(\n                    label=\"Second step\",\n                    description=\"Verify email\",\n                    icon=get_icon(icon=\"ic:outline-email\"),\n                    progressIcon=get_icon(icon=\"ic:outline-email\"),\n                    completedIcon=get_icon(\n                        icon=\"material-symbols:mark-email-read-rounded\"\n                    ),\n                    children=[dmc.Text(\"Step 2 content: Verify email\", ta=\"center\")],\n                ),\n                dmc.StepperStep(\n                    label=\"Final step\",\n                    description=\"Get full access\",\n                    icon=get_icon(icon=\"material-symbols:lock-outline\"),\n                    progressIcon=get_icon(icon=\"material-symbols:lock-outline\"),\n                    completedIcon=get_icon(icon=\"material-symbols:lock-open-outline\"),\n                    children=[dmc.Text(\"Step 3 content: Get full access\", ta=\"center\")],\n                ),\n                dmc.StepperCompleted(\n                    children=[\n                        dmc.Text(\n                            \"Completed, click back button to get to previous step\",\n                            ta=\"center\",\n                        )\n                    ]\n                ),\n            ],\n        ),\n        dmc.Group(\n            justify=\"center\",\n            mt=\"xl\",\n            children=[\n                dmc.Button(\"Back\", id=\"back-custom-icons\", variant=\"default\"),\n                dmc.Button(\"Next step\", id=\"next-custom-icons\"),\n            ],\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"stepper-custom-icons\", \"active\"),\n    Input(\"back-custom-icons\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    Input(\"next-custom-icons\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    State(\"stepper-custom-icons\", \"active\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True,\n)\ndef update_with_icons(back, next_, current):\n    button_id = ctx.triggered_id\n    step = current if current is not None else active\n    if button_id == \"back-custom-icons\":\n        step = step - 1 if step > min_step else step\n    else:\n        step = step + 1 if step < max_step else step\n    return step\n```\n### Vertical orientation\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stepper(\n    active=1,\n    orientation=\"vertical\",\n    children=[\n        dmc.StepperStep(label=\"First step\", description=\"Create an account\"),\n        dmc.StepperStep(label=\"Second step\", description=\"Verify email\"),\n        dmc.StepperStep(label=\"Final step\", description=\"Get full access\"),\n    ],\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

    "content": "\n\n## TableOfContents  \nRenders a list of headings on the page and tracks current heading visible in the viewport  \nCategory: Navigation  \n\n### Usage\n\nUse the `TableOfContents` component to display a table of contents similar to the sidebar in these docs. The\ncomponent tracks scroll position and highlights current heading in the list.\n\nYou can set the style of the `TableOfContents` items (controls) with the `variant`, `color`, `size` and `radius` props:\n\n### Selector\n\n`TableOfContents` is based on Mantine’s [`use-scroll-spy`](https://mantine.dev/hooks/use-scroll-spy/) hook. The `selector`\nprop is passed directly to this hook.\n\nThe `selector` prop is a CSS selector string used to locate and observe heading elements in the DOM.\nThe default value is `'h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6'`.\n\n```python\ndmc.TableOfContents(\n    selector=\"h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6\",  # default\n)\n```\n\nThe selector can be scoped to a container and may use any valid CSS selector syntax, including `:is()`, class selectors, or IDs.\n\nFor example, the following selector matches `h2`, `h3`, and `h4` elements in the `AppShellMain` component, which has the class name `mantine-AppShell-main`:\n\n```python\ndmc.TableOfContents(\n    selector=\".mantine-AppShell-main :is(h2, h3, h4)\"\n)\n```\n\n### Controls\n\nThe `TableOfContents` items (controls) are rendered as HTML `<a>` elements.\nEach control’s `href` attribute is the id of a heading element, and its `children` are set to the heading\nelement’s `textContent`.\n\nThe active control (the currently visible heading) includes a `data-active=\"true\"` attribute, which can be used for styling or testing.\n\n### Depth offset\n\nUse the `minDepthToOffset` prop to control the minimum heading depth at which indentation is applied. By \ndefault, `minDepthToOffset` is 1, which means that first and second level headings will not be offset. Set it to 0 to\napply offset to all headings.\n\nTo control offset value in px, set `depthOffset` prop:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TableOfContents(\n    selector=\".mantine-AppShell-main :is( h2, h3, h4)\",\n    variant=\"filled\",\n    color=\"blue\",\n    size=\"sm\",\n    radius=\"sm\",\n    minDepthToOffset=0,\n    depthOffset=40,\n    w=300\n)\n```\n### autoContrast  \n\n`TableOfContents` supports autoContrast prop and `theme.autoContrast`. If `autoContrast` is set either on `TableOfContents`\nor on `theme`, content color will be adjusted to have sufficient contrast with the value specified in color prop.\n\nNote that `autoContrast` feature works only if you use `color` prop to change background color. `autoContrast` works only with filled variant.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TableOfContents(\n    selector=\".mantine-AppShell-main :is( h2, h3, h4)\",\n    variant=\"filled\",\n    color=\"yellow.3\",\n    autoContrast=True,\n    size=\"sm\",\n    radius=\"sm\",\n    w=300\n)\n```\n### Reinitialize\n\nBy default, heading changes are not tracked automatically. If the content updates in a callback (for example, when switching\ntabs) you can trigger a refresh of the `TableOfContents` by setting `reinitialize=True` in a callback.\n\n\n```python\nfrom dash import Dash, html\nfrom dash import Input, Output, callback\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\napp = Dash()\n\n\ndef make_section(i, name):\n    return dmc.Box(\n        [\n            dmc.Title(children=f\"{name} {i}\", id=f\"section-{i}\", order=3),\n            dmc.Space(h=200),\n        ],\n        p=\"lg\",\n    )\n\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    dmc.AppShell(\n        dmc.AppShellMain(\n            [\n                dmc.Tabs(\n                    [\n                        dmc.TabsList(\n                            [\n                                dmc.TabsTab(\"Tab one\", value=\"1\"),\n                                dmc.TabsTab(\"Tab two\", value=\"2\"),\n                            ]\n                        ),\n                    ],\n                    value=\"1\",\n                    id=\"tabs\",\n                ),\n                dmc.Box(id=\"tabs-content\"),\n                dmc.AppShellAside(\n                    [\n                        dmc.Title(\"Table of Contents\", order=4, mt=60),\n                        dmc.ScrollArea(\n                            dmc.TableOfContents(\n                                selector=\"#tabs-content :is( h2, h3, h4)\", id=\"toc\"\n                            )\n                        ),\n                    ]\n                ),\n            ],\n            p=\"md\",\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"tabs-content\", \"children\"),\n    Output(\"toc\", \"reinitialize\"),\n    Input(\"tabs\", \"value\"),\n)\ndef render_content(active):\n    if active == \"1\":\n        return html.Div([make_section(i, \"Section\") for i in range(30)]), True\n    return html.Div([make_section(i, \"Topic\") for i in range(30)]), True\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n    \n\n### target_id\n\nWith Dash 3+, you do not need to set `reinitialize` in a callback. Instead, set `target_id` to the `id` of a component\nthat is updated by callbacks, and the `TableOfContents` will refresh automatically when that update completes.\n\nUsing the example above, the callback can be simplified. No `reinitialize` output is required when `target_id` is set:\n\n\n```python\nfrom dash import Dash, html\nfrom dash import Input, Output, callback\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\napp = Dash()\n\n\ndef make_section(i, name):\n    return dmc.Box(\n        [\n            dmc.Title(children=f\"{name} {i}\", id=f\"section-{i}\", order=3),\n            dmc.Space(h=200),\n        ],\n        p=\"lg\",\n    )\n\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    dmc.AppShell(\n        dmc.AppShellMain(\n            [\n                dmc.Tabs(\n                    [\n                        dmc.TabsList(\n                            [\n                                dmc.TabsTab(\"Tab one\", value=\"1\"),\n                                dmc.TabsTab(\"Tab two\", value=\"2\"),\n                            ]\n                        ),\n                    ],\n                    value=\"1\",\n                    id=\"tabs\",\n                ),\n                dmc.Box(id=\"tabs-content\"),\n                dmc.AppShellAside(\n                    [\n                        dmc.Title(\"Table of Contents\", order=4, mt=60),\n                        dmc.ScrollArea(\n                            dmc.TableOfContents(\n                                target_id=\"tabs-content\",\n                                selector=\"#tabs-content :is( h2, h3, h4)\",\n                            )\n                        ),\n                    ]\n                ),\n            ],\n            p=\"md\",\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"tabs-content\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"tabs\", \"value\"),\n)\ndef render_content(active):\n    if active == \"1\":\n        return html.Div([make_section(i, \"Section\") for i in range(30)])\n    return html.Div([make_section(i, \"Topic\") for i in range(30)])\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nWhen using Dash Pages, `target_id` defaults to the page container id, so the table of contents is automatically\nrefreshed on each page change without any additional configuration.\n\n### Dash version support\n\n* Dash 3+: `target_id` is supported and replaces the `reinitialize` callback pattern.\n* Dash 2: Use the `reinitialize` prop in a callback as shown above.\n\n### scrollIntoViewOptions\n\n`scrollIntoViewOptions` prop controls how the page scrolls when a heading is clicked in the `TableOfContents`.\n\nThis prop is passed directly to the browser’s [`Element.scrollIntoView`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView)\nAPI and lets you customize the scrolling behavior and alignment of the target heading.\n\nFor example, you can enable smooth scrolling or control where the heading appears in the viewport:\n\n```python\ndmc.TableOfContents(\n    scrollIntoViewOptions={\n        \"behavior\": \"smooth\",\n        \"block\": \"start\",\n    }\n)\n```\n\n### Apps with fixed headers\n\n\nThis example shows how to handle scrolling when the app has a fixed header, such as when using `AppShellHeader`\n\n - The `scrollMarginTop` CSS property is applied to headings so that when a `TableOfContents` item is clicked, the heading is not hidden behind the header.\n - The `offset` prop is passed to the `useScrollSpy` hook to track the correct heading when the app has a fixed header.\n   Set it to the header height so the active item in the `TableOfContents` updates properly when scrolling.\n  \n\n```python\n\nimport dash\nfrom dash import Dash, html\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\napp = Dash(use_pages=True, pages_folder=\"\")\n\n\nlogo = \"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1ff143b-4365-4fd1-880f-3e97aab5c302\"\n\n\ndef make_section(i, page):\n    return dmc.Box(\n        [\n            dmc.Title(\n                children=f\"{page} Title {i}\",\n                id=str(i),\n                order=3,\n                mb=30,\n                style={\"scrollMarginTop\": \"60px\"},\n            ),\n        ],\n        p=\"lg\",\n    )\n\n\nheader = dmc.AppShellHeader(\n    dmc.Group(\n        [\n            dmc.Image(src=logo, h=40, flex=0),\n            dmc.Title(\"Demo App\", c=\"blue\"),\n        ],\n        h=\"100%\",\n        px=\"md\",\n    )\n)\n\naside = dmc.AppShellAside(\n    children=dmc.ScrollArea(\n        dmc.Stack(\n            [\n                dmc.Title(\"Table of contents\", order=5, mt=50),\n                dmc.TableOfContents(\n                    variant=\"filled\",\n                    color=\"blue\",\n                    size=\"sm\",\n                    radius=\"sm\",\n                    selector=\"#appshellmain :is( h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)\",\n                    offset=60,\n                    id=\"toc\",\n                ),\n            ]\n        ),\n        type=\"never\",\n    ),\n    px=\"lg\",\n)\n\ndash.register_page(\n    \"home\",\n    path=\"/\",\n    layout=html.Div([make_section(i, \"home\") for i in range(30)]),\n)\ndash.register_page(\n    \"page1\",\n    path=\"/page-1\",\n    layout=html.Div([make_section(i, \"page1\") for i in range(30)]),\n)\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    children=dmc.AppShell(\n        [\n            header,\n            dmc.AppShellNavbar(\n                [\n                    dmc.Title(\"Page Links\", order=5),\n                    dmc.NavLink(label=\"Home\", href=\"/\", id=\"home\"),\n                    dmc.NavLink(label=\"Page 1\", href=\"/page-1\", id=\"page-1\"),\n                ],\n                p=\"md\",\n            ),\n            dmc.AppShellMain(html.Div(dash.page_container, id=\"appshellmain\")),\n            aside,\n        ],\n        navbar={\"width\": 200},\n        header={\"height\": 60},\n    ),\n)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

If `grow` property \nis set to `True`, controls will take 100% of available space and `justify` property is ignored.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Tabs(\n    children=[\n        dmc.TabsList(\n            justify=\"right\",\n            grow=False,\n            children=[...],\n        )\n        # tabs panel below\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n### Separated Tabs\n\nTo display tab on the opposite side, set `margin-left` to auto with `ml=\"auto\"` in `TabsTab` component.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Tabs(\n    [\n        dmc.TabsList(\n            [\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Gallery\", value=\"gallery\"),\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Messages\", value=\"messages\"),\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Settings\", value=\"settings\", ml=\"auto\"),\n            ]\n        ),\n    ],\n    value=\"gallery\",\n)\n```\n### Inverted Tabs\n\nTo make tabs inverted, place `TabsPanel` components before `TabsList` and add `inverted=True` prop to `Tabs` component.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Tabs(\n    [\n        dmc.TabsPanel(\"Gallery tab content\", value=\"gallery\", pb=\"xs\"),\n        dmc.TabsPanel(\"Messages tab content\", value=\"messages\", pb=\"xs\"),\n        dmc.TabsPanel(\"Settings tab content\", value=\"settings\", pb=\"xs\"),\n        dmc.TabsList(\n            [\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Gallery\", value=\"gallery\"),\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Messages\", value=\"messages\"),\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Settings\", value=\"settings\", ml=\"auto\"),\n            ]\n        ),\n    ],\n    value=\"gallery\",\n    inverted=True,\n)\n```\n### Vertical Tabs placement\n\nTo change placement of `TabsList` in vertical orientation, set `placement` prop in `Tabs`.\n\n### Disabled tabs\n\nSet `disabled=True` prop on `TabsTab` component to disable tab. Disabled tab cannot be activated with mouse or keyboard,\nand they will be skipped when user navigates with arrow keys:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Tabs(\n    [\n        dmc.TabsList(\n            [\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Gallery\", value=\"gallery\"),\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Messages\", value=\"messages\", disabled=True),\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Settings\", value=\"settings\"),\n            ]\n        ),\n        dmc.TabsPanel(\"Gallery tab content\", value=\"gallery\"),\n        dmc.TabsPanel(\"Messages tab content\", value=\"messages\"),\n        dmc.TabsPanel(\"Settings tab content\", value=\"settings\"),\n    ],\n    value=\"gallery\"\n)\n```\n### Activation mode\nBy default, tabs are activated when user presses arrows keys or Home/End keys. To disable that set\n`activateTabWithKeyboard=False` on `Tabs` component.  \n\nThis can be useful if the tab content is updated in a long running callback.  Try clicking on a tab to focus, then\nnavigate to other tabs with arrow keys, or home/end keys:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Tabs(\n    activateTabWithKeyboard=False,\n    children=[\n        # tabs content\n    ],    \n)\n```\n\n### Tab deactivation\nBy default, active tab cannot be deactivated. To allow that set `allowTabDeactivation=True` on Tabs component:\n\nTry clicking on the active tab to see the deactivated state:\n\n\n### Content As Callback\n\nAttach a callback to the Tabs `value` prop and update a container's `children` property in your callback.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Input, Output, html, callback\n\nfrom lib.utils import create_graph\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Tabs(\n            [\n                dmc.TabsList(\n                    [\n                        dmc.TabsTab(\"Tab one\", value=\"1\"),\n                        dmc.TabsTab(\"Tab two\", value=\"2\"),\n                    ]\n                ),\n            ],\n            id=\"tabs-example\",\n            value=\"1\",\n        ),\n        html.Div(id=\"tabs-content\", style={\"paddingTop\": 10}),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"tabs-content\", \"children\"), Input(\"tabs-example\", \"value\"))\ndef render_content(active):\n    if active == \"1\":\n        return [dmc.Text(\"Tab One selected\", my=10), create_graph()]\n    else:\n        return [dmc.Text(\"Tab Two selected\", my=10), create_graph()]\n```\n### Content As Tab Children\n\nInstead of displaying the content through a callback, you can embed the content directly as the `children` property in\nthe Tab component.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nfrom lib.utils import create_graph\n\ncomponent = dmc.Tabs(\n    [\n        dmc.TabsList(\n            [\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Tab one\", value=\"1\"),\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Tab two\", value=\"2\"),\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Tab three\", value=\"3\"),\n            ]\n        ),\n        dmc.TabsPanel(create_graph(), value=\"1\"),\n        dmc.TabsPanel(create_graph(), value=\"2\"),\n        dmc.TabsPanel(create_graph(), value=\"3\"),\n    ],\n    value=\"1\",\n)\n```\n### Styling the Tabs\n\n#### With Props  \n\nThis example demonstrates how to style tabs using only props, without requiring additional CSS files:  \n\n- **Variant**: Sets `variant=\"pills\"` to make the tabs resemble buttons.  \n- **Grow Prop**: Uses the `grow` prop on the `TabsList` component, causing the tabs to expand and fill the full width of the viewport.  \n- **Border**: Adds a border around the tabs with the `bd` prop. For more details, see the [Style Props](/style-props) section.  \n- **Border Color**: Sets the border color using the Mantine CSS variable `var(--mantine-color-default-border)`, ensuring a border color that works well in both light and dark modes. See the [Colors](/colors) section for more details.  \n- **Active Tab Color**: Sets the active tab color with `color=\"green.3\"`. This specifies a lighter shade of a built-in color. Mantine’s color palette includes 10 shades for each color, indexed from 0 (lightest) to 9 (darkest). Learn more in the [Colors](/colors) section.  \n- **Auto Contrast**: Enables `autoContrast=True` to automatically adjust the text color for better readability when using lighter or darker background colors. Additional details can be found in the [Colors](/colors) section.  \n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Tabs(\n    [\n        dmc.TabsList(\n            [\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Gallery\", value=\"gallery\"),\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Messages\", value=\"messages\"),\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Settings\", value=\"settings\"),\n            ],\n            grow=True,\n            bd=\"1px solid var(--mantine-color-default-border)\"\n        ),\n        dmc.TabsPanel(\"Gallery tab content\", value=\"gallery\"),\n        dmc.TabsPanel(\"Messages tab content\", value=\"messages\"),\n        dmc.TabsPanel(\"Settings tab content\", value=\"settings\"),\n    ],\n    color=\"green.3\",\n    autoContrast=True,\n    variant=\"pills\",\n    value=\"gallery\",\n)\n```\n#### With Styles API  \n\nThis example demonstrates styling tabs using the Styles API, allowing for precise control over the appearance of each element in the tabs component. For more information, see the Styles API section below.  \n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Tabs(\n    [\n        dmc.TabsList(\n            [\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Gallery\", value=\"gallery\"),\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Messages\", value=\"messages\"),\n                dmc.TabsTab(\"Settings\", value=\"settings\"),\n            ],\n            grow=True\n        ),\n        dmc.TabsPanel(\"Gallery tab content\", value=\"gallery\"),\n        dmc.TabsPanel(\"Messages tab content\", value=\"messages\"),\n        dmc.TabsPanel(\"Settings tab content\", value=\"settings\"),\n    ],\n    value=\"gallery\",\n    classNames={\"tab\": \"dmc-tabs\"}\n)\n```\nPut the following in a `.css` file in the `/assets` folder\n\n```css\n.dmc-tabs {\n  position: relative;\n  border: 1px solid light-dark(var(--mantine-color-gray-2), var(--mantine-color-dark-4));\n  background-color: light-dark(var(--mantine-color-white), var(--mantine-color-dark-6));\n\n  &:first-of-type {\n    border-radius: 4px 0 0 4px;\n  }\n\n  &:last-of-type {\n    border-radius: 0 4px 4px 0;\n  }\n\n  & + & {\n    border-left-width: 0;\n  }\n\n  &:hover {\n    background-color: light-dark(var(--mantine-color-gray-0), var(--mantine-color-dark-5));\n  }\n\n  &[data-active] {\n    z-index: 1;\n    background-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-filled);\n    border-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-filled);\n    color: var(--mantine-color-white);\n\n    &:hover {\n      background-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-filled-hover);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

    "package": "dash_mantine_components",
    "category": "Navigation",
    "content": "\n\n## Tree  \nDisplay a Tree structure  \nCategory: Navigation  \n\n### Simple Example\n\n`Tree` component is used to display hierarchical data. `Tree` component has minimal styling by default, you can\ncustomize styles with Styles API.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Tree(data=data)\n```\n### Data\n\nData passed to the `data` prop should follow these rules:\n\n- Data must be an array\n- Each item in the array represents a node in the tree\n- Each node must be a dictionary with value and label keys\n- Each node can have children key with an array of child nodes\n- The value of each node must be unique\n\n\n```python\n# ✅ Valid data, all values are unique\nvalid_data = [\n    {\n        \"value\": \"src\",\n        \"label\": \"src\",\n        \"children\": [\n            {\"value\": \"src/components\", \"label\": \"components\"},\n            {\"value\": \"src/hooks\", \"label\": \"hooks\"},\n        ],\n    },\n    {\"value\": \"package.json\", \"label\": \"package.json\"},\n]\n\n# ❌ Invalid data, values are not unique (components is used twice)\ninvalid_data = [\n    {\n        \"value\": \"src\",\n        \"label\": \"src\",\n        \"children\": [{\"value\": \"components\", \"label\": \"components\"}],\n    },\n    {\"value\": \"components\", \"label\": \"components\"},\n]\n\n```\n\n### Icon Side\n\nThe expanded and collapsed icons are on the left side of the label by default.  To move them to the right side, set `iconSide=\"right`\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Tree(data=data, iconSide=\"right\")\n```\n### Remove Expanded Icon\n\nBy default the `Tree` includes a chevron to indicate expanded and collapsed nodes.  To remove the icons, set `expandedIcon=None`\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Tree(data=data, expandedIcon=None)\n```\n### Change Expanded Icon\n\nUse any icon in the `expandedIcon` prop.  If no `collapsedIcon` is set, the icon will be rotated to indicate the collapsed state.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Tree(\n    data=data,\n    expandedIcon=DashIconify(icon=\"fa6-solid:arrow-down\")\n)\n```\n### Change Expanded and Collapsed Icons\n\nWhen both the  `expandedIcon` and `collapsedIcon` props are set, the icons will not be rotated.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Tree(\n    data=data,\n    expandedIcon=DashIconify(icon=\"fa6-regular:folder-open\"),\n    collapsedIcon=DashIconify(icon=\"fa6-solid:folder-plus\"),\n)\n```\n### Set Expanded state\n\nTo set the state of the nodes, use the `expanded` prop.  Note that leaf nodes can be included, but it will only change\nthe expanded/collapsed display of the nodes with children.\n\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import  callback, Input, Output\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.Tree(\n        data=data,\n        expanded=[\n            \"node_modules\",\n            \"node_modules/@mantine\",\n            \"node_modules/@mantine/form\",\n            \"node_modules/@mantine/form/index.d.ts\",\n        ],\n        id=\"tree-expanded\"\n    ),\n    dmc.CodeHighlight(id=\"expanded-nodes\", code=\"\", language=\"json\"),\n])\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"expanded-nodes\", \"code\"),\n    Input(\"tree-expanded\", \"expanded\")\n)\ndef update(expanded):\n    return  json.dumps( expanded, indent=4)\n```\n### Expand or Collapse All\n\nExpand all will include all items of the `data` prop in the `expanded` prop.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n    dmc.SegmentedControl(\n        id=\"tree-expand-all\",\n        data=[\"Expand All\", \"Collapse All\"],\n        value=\"Collapse All\",\n        mb=\"sm\"\n    ),\n\n    dmc.Tree(\n        data=data,\n        id=\"tree-all\"\n    )\n],p=\"lg\")\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"tree-all\", \"expanded\"),\n    Input(\"tree-expand-all\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update(value):\n    if value==\"Collapse All\":\n        return []\n    return '*'\n```\n### Expanded State in callbacks.\n\nWhen using the expanded property as a callback input to track the user's selected expanded state, note that the `expanded`\nlist may include or exclude leaf nodes (nodes without children) depending on user interaction.\n\nThis happens because users can toggle the state of leaf nodes, even though they don’t affect how the tree data is \ndisplayed. To handle this, ensure your callback logic accounts for the possibility that leaf nodes may or may not\nbe present in the `expanded` prop.\n\nNote also that the nodes included in the `expanded` prop are ordered based on user interation and the order of operations.\n\n### With Checkboxes\n\nUse the `checked` prop to set or track the checked items.  Note that only leaves can be checked, and the order will be\nbased on user interation and the order of operations. \n\n```python\nimport json\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.Tree(data=data, checkboxes=True, id=\"tree-checkboxes\" ),\n    dmc.CodeHighlight(id=\"checked-nodes\", code=\"\", language=\"json\"),\n])\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"checked-nodes\", \"code\"),\n    Input(\"tree-checkboxes\", \"checked\")\n)\ndef update(checked):\n    return  json.dumps( checked, indent=4)\n```\n### Custom Tree rendering\n\nBy default, `dmc.Tree` includes a built-in `renderNode` function that covers most common use cases. It requires no \nJavaScript and supports some customization through props like `checkboxes`, `expandedIcon`, and `iconSide`.\n\nIf you need more control over how each node is rendered, such as using custom icons based on the data, arranging content\ndifferently or advanced styling, you can provide your own `renderNode` function written in JavaScript. This advanced\nfeature is designed for use cases that go beyond what the built-in options support.\n\n#### Ignored Props\n\nWhen you supply your own `renderNode` function, the following props are ignored:\n\n* `checkboxes`\n* `expandedIcon`\n* `collapsedIcon`\n* `iconSide`\n\nThese props only apply when you're using the default built-in renderer. If you're using a custom `renderNode`, you are\nresponsible for rendering icons, checkboxes, or any other visual element.\n\n\n#### Example: Files Tree \n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nimport dash_iconify  # required in order to use DashIconify in the renderNode function\nfrom .data import data\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Tree(\n    data=data,\n    renderNode={\"function\": \"myLeaf\"},\n    expanded=[\n        \"node_modules\",\n        \"node_modules/react\",\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\n\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.myLeaf = function (payload) {\n  const dmc = window.dash_mantine_components;\n  const iconify = window.dash_iconify;\n\n  function getIcon(name, isFolder, expanded) {\n    const size = 14;\n\n    if (name.endsWith('package.json')) {\n      return React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, {\n        icon: 'logos:npm-icon',\n        width: size,\n        height: size\n      });\n    }\n\n    if (\n      name.endsWith('.ts') ||\n      name.endsWith('.tsx') ||\n      name.endsWith('tsconfig.json')\n    ) {\n      return React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, {\n        icon: 'logos:typescript-icon',\n        width: size,\n        height: size\n      });\n    }\n\n    if (name.endsWith('.css')) {\n      return React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, {\n        icon: 'vscode-icons:file-type-css',\n        width: size,\n        height: size\n      });\n    }\n\n    if (isFolder) {\n      return React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, {\n        icon: expanded ? 'tabler:folder-open' : 'tabler:folder',\n        width: size,\n        height: size,\n        color: '#f59f00' // Mantine yellow-9\n      });\n    }\n\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const { node, expanded, hasChildren, elementProps } = payload;\n\n  return React.createElement(\n    dmc.Group,\n    { key: payload.node.value, gap: 5, ...elementProps },\n    getIcon(node.value, hasChildren, expanded),\n    React.createElement('span', null, node.label)\n  );\n};\n```\n\n#### Example:  Tree with Checkboxes\n\n\nNote: This example uses custom JavaScript defined in the assets folder. Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n\nIf the \"With Checkboxes\" example above does not meet your needs, you can use the `renderNode` prop to fully customize\nhow each tree node is rendered using JavaScript.\n\nWhen using a custom `renderNode`, you are responsible for implementing the checkbox and expand/collapse logic yourself.\nTo handle the checked state, you'll need to render a `CheckboxIndicator` manually inside your custom render function\nand call `tree.checkNode(...)` or `tree.uncheckNode(...)` to update it.\n\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\nimport dash_iconify # necessary to import here in order to use in the renderNode function\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.Tree(\n        data=data,\n        levelOffset=23,\n        expandOnClick=False,\n        renderNode={\"function\": \"myLeafCheckbox\"},\n        id=\"tree-checkboxes-renderNode\" ),\n    dmc.CodeHighlight(id=\"checked-nodes-renderNode\", code=\"\", language=\"json\"),\n])\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"checked-nodes-renderNode\", \"code\"),\n    Input(\"tree-checkboxes-renderNode\", \"checked\")\n)\ndef update(checked):\n    return  json.dumps( checked, indent=4)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.myLeafCheckbox = function (payload) {\n  const React = window.React;\n  const dmc = window.dash_mantine_components;\n  const iconify = window.dash_iconify;\n\n  const { node, expanded, hasChildren, elementProps, tree } = payload;\n\n  const checked = tree.isNodeChecked(node.value);\n  const indeterminate = tree.isNodeIndeterminate(node.value);\n\n  return React.createElement(\n    dmc.Group,\n    { key: node.value, gap: \"xs\", ...elementProps },\n    [\n      React.createElement(dmc.CheckboxIndicator, {\n        key: \"checkbox\",\n        checked,\n        indeterminate,\n        onClick: (e) => {\n          e.stopPropagation();\n          if (checked) {\n            tree.uncheckNode(node.value);\n          } else {\n            tree.checkNode(node.value);\n          }\n        },\n      }),\n      React.createElement(\n        dmc.Group,\n        {\n          key: \"label-group\",\n          gap: 5,\n          onClick: () => tree.toggleExpanded(node.value),\n        },\n        [\n          React.createElement(\"span\", { key: \"label\" }, node.label),\n          hasChildren &&\n            React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, {\n              key: \"icon\",\n              icon: \"tabler:chevron-down\",\n              width: 14,\n              style: {\n                transform: expanded ? \"rotate(180deg)\" : \"rotate(0deg)\",\n                transition: \"transform 0.2s ease\",\n              },\n            }),\n        ]\n      ),\n    ]\n  );\n};\n```\n\n#### renderNode Arguments\n\nThe `renderNode` function receives a single `payload` object with the following fields:\n\n```js\nexport interface RenderTreeNodePayload {\n  /** Node level in the tree */\n  level: number;\n\n  /** `true` if the node is expanded, applicable only for nodes with `children` */\n  expanded: boolean;\n\n  /** `true` if the node has non-empty `children` array */\n  hasChildren: boolean;\n\n  /** `true` if the node is selected */\n  selected: boolean;\n\n  /** Node data from the `data` prop of `Tree` */\n  node: TreeNodeData;\n\n  /** Tree controller instance, return value of `useTree` hook */\n  tree: TreeController;\n\n  /** Props to spread into the root node element */\n  elementProps: {\n    className: string;\n    style: React.CSSProperties;\n    onClick: (event: React.MouseEvent) => void;\n    'data-selected': boolean | undefined;\n    'data-value': string;\n    'data-hovered': boolean | undefined;\n  };\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

Set the `opened` property to open the drawer. The drawer can be controlled in following ways:\n\n* programmatically (using callbacks)\n* by clicking on the cross button (if not disabled using `withCloseButton` prop)\n* by clicking outside the drawer area (if not disabled using `closeOnClickOutside` prop)\n* by pressing the ESC key (if not disabled using `closeOnEscape` prop)\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, Output, Input, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Open Drawer\", id=\"drawer-demo-button\"),\n        dmc.Drawer(\n            title=\"Drawer Example\",\n            id=\"drawer-simple\",\n            padding=\"md\",\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"drawer-simple\", \"opened\"),\n    Input(\"drawer-demo-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True,\n)\ndef drawer_demo(n_clicks):\n    return True\n```\n### Different Sizes\n\nSet the size of the drawer using the `size` prop.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, Output, Input, State, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Drawer(title=\"Size: md\", id=\"drawer-size-md\", padding=\"md\", size=\"md\"),\n        dmc.Drawer(\n            title=\"Size: 450px\",\n            id=\"drawer-size-450\",\n            padding=\"md\",\n            size=450,\n        ),\n        dmc.Drawer(\n            title=\"Size:

Placement\n\nBy default, Drawer will start to appear from the left, but this position can be customized by setting the `position` \nprop.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, Output, Input, State, callback\n\ndata = [\n    [\"Left (Default)\", \"left\"],\n    [\"Top\", \"top\"],\n    [\"Right\", \"right\"],\n    [\"Bottom\", \"bottom\"],\n]\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Drawer(\n            id=\"drawer-position\",\n        ),\n        dmc.Group(\n            align=\"center\",\n            gap=\"xl\",\n            children=[\n                dmc.RadioGroup(\n                    dmc.Group([dmc.Radio(label, value=value) for label, value in data]),\n                    id=\"drawer-position-radio\",\n                    value=\"left\",\n                ),\n                dmc.Button(\"Open Drawer\", id=\"drawer-position-button\"),\n            ],\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"drawer-position\", \"opened\"),\n    Output(\"drawer-position\", \"position\"),\n    Input(\"drawer-position-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    State(\"drawer-position-radio\", \"value\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True,\n)\ndef toggle_drawer(n_clicks, position):\n    return True, position\n```\n### Transition\n\nYou can customize transition, timing function and duration for Drawer transition.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, Output, Input, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Open Drawer\", id=\"drawer-transition-button\"),\n        dmc.Drawer(\n            title=\"Drawer Example\",\n            id=\"drawer-fancy\",\n            padding=\"md\",\n            transitionProps={\n                \"transition\": \"rotate-left\",\n                \"duration\": 1000,\n                \"timingFunction\": \"ease\",\n            },\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"drawer-fancy\", \"opened\"),\n    Input(\"drawer-transition-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True,\n)\ndef drawer_demo(n_clicks):\n    return True\n```\n### Drawer Stack\n\nUse `DrawerStack` component to render multiple drawers at the same time. `DrawerStack` keeps track of opened drawers, \nmanages `z-index` values, focus trapping and `closeOnEscape` behavior.\n\nDifferences from using multiple Drawer components:\n\n- `DrawerStack` children must be `ManagedDrawer` components\n- `DrawerStack` manages `z-index` values – drawers that are opened later will always have higher `z-index` value disregarding their order in the DOM\n- `DrawerStack` disables focus trap and `Escape` key handling for all drawers except the one that is currently opened\n- Drawers that are not currently visible are present in the DOM but are hidden with `opacity: 0` and `pointer-events: none`\n- Only one overlay is rendered at a time\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import  Output, Input, callback, ctx, no_update\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center([\n    dmc.DrawerStack(\n        id=\"drawer-stack\",\n        children=[\n            dmc.ManagedDrawer(\n

So adding a margin\nto your target component will also move the dropdown away. In order to prevent this, add margin to the wrapper component\nusing the prop `boxWrapperProps` in dmc.HoverCardTarget.\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

    "content": "\n\n## Menu  \nUse the Menu and MenuX components to show an interactive menu dropdown with links and buttons.  \nCategory: Overlay  \n\n### Simple Example\n\nMenu is built using MenuItem(s), MenuDropdown and MenuTarget. You can use MenuItem as either a link or a button. Just passing the `href` property will make it a link otherwise it will act as a button.\nWhen MenuItem is used as a button, you can write callbacks on it.\n\n```python\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, html, Input, Output\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack(\n    [\n        dmc.Text(id=\"menu-text\", mb=\"md\"),\n        dmc.Menu(\n            [\n                dmc.MenuTarget(dmc.Button(\"Click for options!\")),\n                dmc.MenuDropdown(\n                    [\n                        dmc.MenuItem(\n                            \"External Link\",\n                            href=\"https://www.github.com/snehilvj\",\n                            target=\"_blank\",\n                            leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"radix-icons:external-link\"),\n                        ),\n                        dmc.MenuItem(\"Useless Button\", id=\"useless-button\", n_clicks=0),\n                    ]\n                ),\n            ]\n        ),\n    ], align=\"center\"\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"menu-text\", \"children\"), Input(\"useless-button\", \"n_clicks\"))\ndef click_menu(n_clicks):\n    return f\"Clicked {n_clicks} times.\"\n```\n### Submenus\n\n```python\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\nmenu = dmc.Menu(\n    width=200,\n    position=\"bottom-start\",\n    children=[\n        dmc.MenuTarget(\n            dmc.Button(\"Toggle Menu\")\n        ),\n        dmc.MenuDropdown([\n            dmc.MenuItem(\"Dashboard\"),\n\n            dmc.SubMenu([\n                dmc.SubMenuTarget(\n                    dmc.SubMenuItem(\"Products\")\n                ),\n                dmc.SubMenuDropdown([\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"All products\"),\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Categories\"),\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Tags\"),\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Attributes\"),\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Shipping classes\"),\n                ])\n            ]),\n\n            dmc.SubMenu([\n                dmc.SubMenuTarget(\n                    dmc.SubMenuItem(\"Orders\")\n                ),\n                dmc.SubMenuDropdown([\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Open\"),\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Completed\"),\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Cancelled\"),\n                ])\n            ]),\n\n            dmc.SubMenu([\n                dmc.SubMenuTarget(\n                    dmc.SubMenuItem(\"Settings\")\n                ),\n                dmc.SubMenuDropdown([\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Profile\"),\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Security\"),\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Notifications\"),\n                ])\n            ]),\n        ])\n    ]\n)\n\ncomponent=dmc.Center(menu)\n```\n\n\n### Menu on Hover\n\nSet `trigger` to `hover` to reveal dropdown when user hovers over menu target and dropdown. `closeDelay` and `openDelay` props can be used to control open and close delay in ms.\nNote that:\n\n* If you set `closeDelay=0` then menu will close before user will reach dropdown, so set `offset=0` to remove space between target element and dropdown.\n* Menu with hover trigger is not accessible - users that navigate with keyboard will not be able to use it.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Menu(trigger=\"hover\", openDelay=100, closeDelay=400, children=[\n  # menu target\n  # menu dropdown\n    # menu items\n])\n```\n\n### Menu Target\n\nAny component you specify in dmc.MenuTarget is wrapped by a dmc.Box component under the hood. So adding a margin\nto your target component will also move the dropdown away. In order to prevent this, add margin to the wrapper component\nusing the prop `boxWrapperProps` in dmc.MenuTarget.\n\n### Transitions\n\nMenu dropdown can be animated with any of the ready-made transitions.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Menu(\n    [\n        dmc.MenuTarget(dmc.Button(\"Click for options!\")),\n        dmc.MenuDropdown(\n            [\n                dmc.MenuItem(\n                    \"External Link\",\n                    href=\"https://www.github.com/snehilvj\",\n                    target=\"_blank\",\n                    leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"radix-icons:external-link\"),\n                ),\n                dmc.MenuItem(\"Useless Button\", n_clicks=0),\n            ]\n        ),\n    ],\n    transitionProps={\"transition\": \"rotate-right\", \"duration\": 150},\n)\n```\n### Custom component as Target\n\n```python\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Menu(\n    [\n        dmc.MenuTarget(dmc.ActionIcon(DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:user\"))),\n        dmc.MenuDropdown(\n            [\n                dmc.MenuItem(\n                    \"External Link\",\n                    href=\"https://www.github.com/snehilvj\",\n                    target=\"_blank\",\n                    leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"radix-icons:external-link\"),\n                ),\n                dmc.MenuItem(\"Useless Button\", n_clicks=0),\n            ]\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Icons, Right Section, and Colors\n\nMenu component can be customised by changing icons, right section and even colors. Here's an example.\n\n```python\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Menu(\n    [\n        dmc.MenuTarget(dmc.Button(\"Hover for options!\")),\n        dmc.MenuDropdown(\n            [\n                dmc.MenuLabel(\"Application\"),\n                dmc.MenuItem(\n                    \"Settings\", leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:settings\")\n                ),\n                dmc.MenuItem(\n                    \"Messages\", leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:message\")\n                ),\n                dmc.MenuItem(\"Gallery\", leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:photo\")),\n                dmc.MenuItem(\"Search\", leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:search\")),\n                dmc.MenuDivider(),\n                dmc.MenuLabel(\"Danger Zone\"),\n                dmc.MenuItem(\n                    \"Transfer my data\",\n                    leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:arrows-left-right\"),\n                ),\n                dmc.MenuItem(\n                    \"Delete my account\",\n                    leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"tabler:trash\"),\n                    color=\"red\",\n                ),\n            ]\n        ),\n    ],\n    trigger=\"hover\",\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

You can also customize it by setting the desired `radius` or `padding`.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, Output, Input, State, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Open Modal\", id=\"modal-demo-button\"),\n        dmc.Modal(\n            title=\"New Modal\",\n            id=\"modal-simple\",\n            children=[\n                dmc.Text(\"I am in a modal component.\"),\n                dmc.Space(h=20),\n                dmc.Group(\n                    [\n                        dmc.Button(\"Submit\", id=\"modal-submit-button\"),\n                        dmc.Button(\n                            \"Close\",\n                            color=\"red\",\n                            variant=\"outline\",\n                            id=\"modal-close-button\",\n                        ),\n                    ],\n                    justify=\"flex-end\",\n                ),\n            ],\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"modal-simple\", \"opened\"),\n    Input(\"modal-demo-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    Input(\"modal-close-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    Input(\"modal-submit-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    State(\"modal-simple\", \"opened\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True,\n)\ndef modal_demo(nc1, nc2, nc3, opened):\n    return not opened\n```\n### Different Sizes\n\nSet the size of the modal using the `size` prop.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, Output, Input, State, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Modal(title=\"Size: lg\", id=\"modal-size-lg\", size=\"lg\"),\n        dmc.Modal(title=\"Size: 378px\", id=\"modal-size-378\", size=378),\n        dmc.Modal(title=\"Size: 55%\", id=\"modal-size-55\", size=\"55%\"),\n        dmc.Modal(title=\"Size: full\", id=\"modal-size-full\", fullScreen=True),\n        dmc.Group(\n            [\n                dmc.Button(\"lg\", id=\"lg-modal-button\"),\n                dmc.Button(\"378px\", id=\"378-modal-button\"),\n                dmc.Button(\"55%\", id=\"55-modal-button\"),\n                dmc.Button(\"full\", id=\"full-modal-button\"),\n            ]\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n\ndef toggle_modal(n_clicks, opened):\n    return not opened\n\n\nfor size in [\"lg\", \"378\", \"55\", \"full\"]:\n    callback(\n        Output(f\"modal-size-{size}\", \"opened\"),\n        Input(f\"{size}-modal-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n        State(f\"modal-size-{size}\", \"opened\"),\n        prevent_initial_call=True,\n    )(toggle_modal)\n```\n### Vertically Centered Modal\n\nTo vertically center the modal, set `centered=True`.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, Output, Input, State, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Modal(\n            title=\"Centered Modal\",\n            id=\"modal-centered\",\n            centered=True,\n            children=[dmc.Text(\"This is a vertically centered modal.\")],\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\"Open modal\", id=\"modal-centered-button\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"modal-centered\", \"opened\"),\n    Input(\"modal-centered-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    State(\"modal-centered\", \"opened\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True,\n)\ndef toggle_modal(n_clicks, opened):\n    return not opened\n```\n### Modal With Scroll\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, Output, Input, State, callback\n\nparagraph = (\n    \"\"\"Dash apps give a point-&-click interface to models written in Python, vastly expanding the notion of what's \n        possible in a traditional 'dashboard.'

    "category": "Overlay",
    "content": "\n\n## Popover  \nDisplay popover section relative to given target element.  \nCategory: Overlay  \n\n### Simple Example\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Popover(\n    [\n        dmc.PopoverTarget(dmc.Button(\"Toggle Popover\")),\n        dmc.PopoverDropdown(dmc.Text(\"This popover is opened on button click\")),\n    ],\n    width=200,\n    position=\"bottom\",\n    withArrow=True,\n    shadow=\"md\",\n)\n```\n### Popover Target\n\nAny component you specify in dmc.PopoverTarget is wrapped by a dmc.Box component under the hood. So adding a margin\nto your target component will also move the dropdown away. In order to prevent this, add margin to the wrapper component\nusing the prop `boxWrapperProps` in dmc.PopoverTarget.\n\n### Focus Trap\n\nIf you need to use any interactive elements within Popover, set `trapFocus` prop:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Popover(\n    [\n        dmc.PopoverTarget(dmc.Button(\"Toggle Popover\")),\n        dmc.PopoverDropdown(\n            [\n                dmc.TextInput(label=\"Name\", placeholder=\"Name\", size=\"xs\"),\n                dmc.TextInput(\n                    label=\"Email\", placeholder=\"john@doe.com\", size=\"xs\", mt=\"xs\"\n                ),\n            ]\n        ),\n    ],\n    width=300,\n    position=\"bottom\",\n    withArrow=True,\n    trapFocus=True,\n    shadow=\"md\",\n)\n```\n### Inline elements\n\nEnable inline middleware to use Popover with inline elements.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Flex(\n    [\n        \"Here is some text with\",\n        dmc.Popover(\n            [\n                dmc.PopoverTarget(dmc.Mark(\" an inline popover \")),\n                dmc.PopoverDropdown(\" more info\"),\n            ],\n            middlewares={\"flip\": True, \"shift\": True, \"inline\": True},\n        ),\n        \"and more text after.\",\n    ],\n    direction=\"row\",\n    gap=\"xs\",\n)\n```\n### Same width\n\nSet w=\"target\" prop to make Popover dropdown take the same width as target element.\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Popover(\n    [\n        dmc.PopoverTarget(dmc.Button(\"Toggle Popover\", w=200)),\n        dmc.PopoverDropdown(\n            dmc.Text(\n                \"This popover has same width as target, it is useful when you are building input dropdowns\"\n            )\n        ),\n    ],\n    width=\"target\",\n    position=\"bottom\",\n    withArrow=True,\n    shadow=\"md\",\n)\n```\n### With overlay\nSet `withOverlay` prop to add overlay behind the dropdown. You can pass additional configuration to `Overlay` component with `overlayProps` prop:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Popover(\n    [\n        dmc.PopoverTarget(dmc.Button(\"Toggle Popover\")),\n        dmc.PopoverDropdown(dmc.Text(\"This popover is opened on button click\")),\n    ],\n    width=200,\n    position=\"bottom\",\n    withArrow=True,\n    shadow=\"md\",\n    withOverlay=True,\n    overlayProps={\"zIndex\": 10000, \"blur\": '8px'},\n    zIndex=10001\n)\n```\n### Hide detached\n\nUse `hideDetached` prop to configure how the dropdown behaves when the target element is hidden with styles \n(`display: none, visibility: hidden,` etc.), removed from the DOM, or when the target element is scrolled out of the viewport.\n\nBy default, `hideDetached` is enabled – the dropdown is hidden with the target element. You can change this behavior\nwith `hideDetached=False`. To see the difference, try to scroll the container that holds the Popover components:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box(\n    style={\"border\": \"1px solid var(--mantine-color-dimmed)\", \"overflow\": \"auto\"},\n    p=\"xl\",\n    w=400,\n    h=200,\n    children=[\n        dmc.Box(\n            w=1000,\n            h=400,\n            children=dmc.Group(\n                [\n                    dmc.Popover(\n                        opened=True,\n                        width=\"target\",\n                        position=\"bottom\",\n                        closeOnClickOutside=False,\n                        children=[\n                            dmc.PopoverTarget(\n                                dmc.Button(\"Toggle popover\")\n                            ),\n                            dmc.PopoverDropdown(\"This popover dropdown is hidden when detached\"),\n                        ],\n                    ),\n                    dmc.Popover(\n                        opened=True,\n                        width=\"target\",\n                        position=\"bottom\",\n                        closeOnClickOutside=False,\n                        hideDetached=False,\n                        children=[\n                            dmc.PopoverTarget(\n                                dmc.Button(\"Toggle popover\")\n                            ),\n                            dmc.PopoverDropdown(\"This popover dropdown is visible when detached\"),\n                        ],\n                    ),\n                ]\n            ),\n        )\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Click outside\nBy default, `Popover` closes when you click outside of the dropdown. To disable this behavior, set `closeOnClickOutside=False`.\n\nYou can configure events that are used for click outside detection with `clickOutsideEvents` prop. By default, `Popover`\nlistens to `mousedown` and `touchstart` events. You can change it to any other events, for example, `mouseup` and `touchend`:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Popover(\n    width=200,\n    position=\"bottom\",\n    clickOutsideEvents=[\"mouseup\", \"touchend\"],\n    children=[\n        dmc.PopoverTarget(\n            dmc.Button(\"Toggle popover\", id=\"toggle-btn\")\n        ),\n        dmc.PopoverDropdown(\n            dmc.Text(\n                \"Popover will be closed with mouseup and touchend events\",\n                size=\"xs\"\n            )\n        )\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n#### Popover Selectors\n\n| Selector  | Static selector             | Description          |\n|-----------|------------------------------|----------------------|\n| dropdown  | .mantine-Popover-dropdown    | Dropdown element     |\n| arrow     | .mantine-Popover-arrow       | Dropdown arrow       |\n| overlay   | .mantine-Popover-overlay     | Overlay element      |\n\n\n#### Popover CSS Variables\n\n| Selector  | Variable           | Description                    |\n|-----------|--------------------|--------------------------------|\n| dropdown  | --popover-radius   | Controls dropdown border-radius |\n|           | --popover-shadow   | Controls dropdown box-shadow    |\n\n\n#### Popover Data Attributes\n\n| Selector  | Attribute       | Value                             |\n|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|\n| dropdown  | data-position   | Value of floating UI dropdown position |\n\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### Popover\n\n- children (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):\n    `Popover.Target` and `Popover.Dropdown` components.\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- arrowOffset (number; optional):\n    Arrow offset in px, `5` by default.\n\n- arrowPosition (a value equal to: 'center', 'side'; optional):\n    Arrow position.\n\n- arrowRadius (number; optional):\n    Arrow `border-radius` in px, `0` by default.\n\n- arrowSize (number; optional):\n    Arrow size in px, `7` by default.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

    "content": "\n\n## Tooltip  \nUse Tooltip component to render tooltip at given element on mouse over or any other event  \nCategory: Overlay  \n\n### Introduction\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Tooltip(\n    dmc.Button(\"Button with tooltip\"),\n    label=\"Tooltip\"\n)\n```\n### Interactive example\n\n### Colors\n\nTooltip supports all colors defined in Mantine's theme colors.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Tooltip(\n    label=\"This is a red colored tooltip.\",\n    color=\"red\"\n)\n```\n\n### Position\n\nTooltip position relative to target element is defined by the `position` prop.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Tooltip(\n    label=\"This is a tooltip\",\n    position=\"right\",\n    children=[...]\n)\n```\n\n### Offset\nThe `offset` sets the space between tooltip and target element in px, can be negative.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Tooltip(\n    label=\"This is a tooltip\",\n    position=\"right\",\n    offset=5,\n    children=[...]\n)\n```\n### Offset multi axis\n\nTo control `offset` on both axis, pass dictionary with `mainAxis` and `crossAxis` properties:\n\nFor an interactive demo see the [Mantine docs](https://mantine.dev/core/tooltip/#offset)\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Tooltip(\n    label=\"This is a tooltip\",\n    position=\"top\",\n    offset={ \"mainAxis\": 50, \"crossAxis\": -50},\n    children=[...]\n)\n```\n\n\n\n### Arrow\n\nSet `withArrow` prop to add an arrow to the tooltip. Arrow is a div element rotated with `transform: rotate(45deg)`.\n\n`arrowPosition` prop determines how arrow is position relative to the target element when position is set to `*-start` \nand `*-end` values on `Popover` component. By default, the value is `center` – the arrow is positioned in the center of\nthe target element if it is possible.\n\nIf you change `arrowPosition` to `side`, then the arrow will be positioned on the side of the target element, and you\nwill be able to control arrow offset with `arrowOffset` prop. Note that when `arrowPosition` is set to `center`, \n`arrowOffset` prop is ignored.\n\n### Multiline\n\nBy default, tooltip white-space property is set to nowrap. To change that use:\n\n* `multiline` - to enable line breaks\n* `w` - to define tooltip width in px\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    [\n        dmc.Tooltip(\n            multiline=True,\n            w=220,\n            withArrow=True,\n            label=\"Use this button to save this information in your profile,\"\n            \" after that you will be able to access it any time and share\"\n            \" it via email.\",\n            children=dmc.Button(\"Multiline Tooltip\", variant=\"outline\"),\n        )\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Inline\n\nUse the `boxWrapperProps` to style the tooltip for inline elements.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Text(\n    [\n        \"NASA’s \",\n        dmc.Tooltip(\n            dmc.Mark(\"JWST\"),\n            label=\"James Webb Space Telescope\",\n            boxWrapperProps={\"style\": {\"display\": \"inline-block\"}},\n        ),\n        \" is the most powerful space telescope ever built.\",\n    ],\n    span=True,\n)\n```\n### Transitions\n\nTooltip is built with Transition component, it supports the following props.\n\n* `transition` - predefined transition name or transition object\n* `duration` - transition duration in ms, defaults to 100ms\n* `timingFunction` - timing function\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Tooltip(\n    label=\"Fade transitions\",\n    transitionProps={\n        \"transition\": \"fade\", \n        \"duration\": 200,\n        \"timingFunction\": \"ease\"\n    },\n    children=[\n        # children\n    ],\n)\n```\n\n### Close and Open Delay\n\nYou can delay tooltip open/close events by setting `openDelay` and `closeDelay` props in ms. Both props default to 0 \nand reset if user moves mouse over/out of target element before delay is expired.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.Tooltip(\n            dmc.Button(\"Delay Open - 500ms\", variant=\"outline\"),\n            label=\"Opened after 500ms\",\n            openDelay=500,\n        ),\n        dmc.Tooltip(\n            dmc.Button(\"Delay Close - 500ms\", variant=\"outline\"),\n            label=\"Closed after 500ms\",\n            closeDelay=500,\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Floating Tooltip\n\n`dmc.FloatingTooltip` component has the same API as `dmc.Tooltip` component but tooltip will follow mouse.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    [\n        dmc.FloatingTooltip(\n            label=\"Tooltip\",\n            color=\"orange\",\n            children=[\n                dmc.Center(\n                    dmc.Text(\"Hover over the box to see tooltip\"),\n                    style={\n                        \"height\": 100,\n                        \"padding\": 10,\n                        \"border\": \"2px solid  var(--mantine-color-gray-6)\",\n                    },\n                )\n            ],\n        )\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Target\n\n`target` prop is an alternative to the `Tooltip` `children`. It accepts a string (selector), an HTML element or a `ref`\nobject with HTML element. Use target prop when you do not render tooltip target as JSX element, like when creating a Tooltip\ncomponent in a clientside callback.\n\nExample of using target prop with a string selector:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n    dmc.Button(\"Hover me to see tooltip\", id=\"my-target\"),\n    dmc.Tooltip(target=\"#my-target\", label=\"Tooltip over button\")\n])\n```\n### Limitations\n#### Setting width\n\nTooltip children are wrapped in a `Box` with a default width of `fit-content`, which may override the width defined in the children. To work around this, you can set the width using `boxWrapperProps`.\n\n`boxWrapperProps` is a dictionary of style properties passed to the `Box` that wraps the tooltip children. In this example, both the `Textarea` and `boxWrapperProps` are used to set the width to 100%.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Tooltip(\n    label=\"tooltip label\",\n    children=dmc.Textarea(\n        value=\"How to set the width of the textarea with a tooltip to 100%\", w=\"100%\"\n    ),\n    boxWrapperProps={\"w\": \"100%\"},\n)\n```\n#### Tooltip margin\n\nAny component you specify in `Tooltip` `children` prop is wrapped by a `Box` component under the hood. So adding a margin\nto your target component will also move the tooltip away. In order to prevent this, add margin to the wrapper component\nusing the prop `boxWrapperProps` in `Tooltip`.\n\n\n\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n#### Tooltip selectors\n\n| Selector | Static selector | Description |\n|----------|----------------|-------------|\n| tooltip  | .mantine-Tooltip-tooltip | Root element |\n| arrow    | .mantine-Tooltip-arrow   | Tooltip arrow, rendered inside tooltip |\n\n#### Tooltip CSS variables\n\n| Selector | Variable | Description |\n|----------|----------|-------------|\n| tooltip  | --tooltip-bg | Tooltip background-color |\n| tooltip  | --tooltip-radius | Tooltip border-radius |\n| tooltip  | --tooltip-color | Controls tooltip text color |\n\n#### Tooltip data attributes\n\n| Selector | Attribute | Condition |\n|----------|-----------|------------|\n| tooltip  | data-multiline | `multiline` prop is set |\n\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### Tooltip\n\n- children (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):\n    Target element, must support `ref` prop and `...others`.\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- arrowOffset (number; optional):\n    Arrow offset in px, `5` by default.\n\n- arrowPosition (a value equal to: 'center', 'side'; optional):\n    Arrow position relative to the tooltip, `side` by default.\n\n- arrowRadius (number; optional):\n    Arrow `border-radius` in px, `0` by default.\n\n- arrowSize (number; optional):\n    Arrow size in px, `4` by default.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

For more information see the [Mantine 8 Changelog.](https://mantine.dev/changelog/8-0-0/)\nand the [DMC 2.0.0 Release announcement.]( /release-2-0-0)\n\nStarting with DMC v2.3.0,` RichTextEditor` uses Tiptap v3. There are no known breaking changes, but projects with\ncustomizations—such as clientside callbacks that rely on the Tiptap API or custom controls—should check for compatibility.\nThe Text Style API has also been updated, which may affect how JSON and HTML content are generated. For details on\nchanges and new features, see the [Tiptap v3 changelog](https://tiptap.dev/docs/resources/whats-new).\n\n\n#### Switch withThumbIndicator\n\n[Switch](/components/switch) component default styles were updated, it now includes checked state indicator inside the\nthumb. If you want to use old styles without indicator, set `withThumbIndicator` prop to false in theme:\n\n```python\ndmc.MantineProvider(    \n    theme={\n        \"components\": {\n            \"Switch\": {\n                \"defaultProps\": {\n                    # ✅ Disable withThumbIndicator if you want to use old styles\n                    \"withThumbIndicator\": False,                  \n                },\n            },\n        },\n    }\n)\n```\n#### DatesProvider timezone\nDatesProvider component no longer supports timezone option:\n\n```python\ndmc.DatesProvider(\n    # children= ...\n    # ❌ timezone option is no longer supported\n    setting={\"timezone\": 'UTC', \"consistentWeeks\": True}\n)\n```\n\n\n\n#### DateTimePicker timeInputProps\n`DateTimePicker` component no longer accepts `timeInputProps` prop, as the underlying `TimeInput` component was\nreplaced with `TimePicker`. To pass props down to `TimePicker` component, use `timePickerProps` prop instead.\n\n1.x\n```python\ndmc.DateTimePicker(\n    # ❌ timeInputProps is no longer available\n      timeInputProps={\n        \"leftSection\": dashIconify(icon=\"bi:clock\"),\n      }\n)\n```\n\n2.x\n```python\ndmc.DateTimePicker(\n    #   ✅ Use timePickerProps instead of timeInputProps\n      timePickerProps={\n        \"leftSection\": dashIconify(icon=\"bi:clock\"),\n         \"minutesStep\": 5,\n        \"withDropdown\": True,\n      }\n)\n```\n\n#### CodeHighlight usage\n\nTo reduce the bundle size and increase performance,  only the top 10 languages from highlight.js are available.  See [CodeHighlight](/components/code-highlight)\nfor more details.  If you would like additional languages, please open an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/issues)\n\n\n#### Popover hideDetached\n`Popover` now supports `hideDetached` prop to automatically close popover when target element is removed from the DOM.\nPlease see the example in the [Popover docs](/components/popover)\n\nBy default, `hideDetached` is enabled – the behavior has changed from 1.x version. If you prefer to keep the old\nbehavior, you can disable `hideDetached` for all components:\n\n\n```python\ndmc.MantineProvider(    \n    theme={\n        \"components\": {\n            \"Popover\": {\n                \"defaultProps\": {\n                    #  ✅ Disable hideDetached by default if you want to keep the old behavior\n                    \"hideDetached\": False,                  \n                },\n            },\n        },\n    }\n)\n```\n\n#### Carousel changes\n\nUpdate embla props that were previously passed to `Carousel` component to `emblaOptions`. Full list of props:\n\n- `loop`\n- `align`\n- `slidesToScroll`\n- `dragFree`\n- `inViewThreshold`\n- `skipSnaps`\n- `containScroll`\n- `speed` and `draggable` props were removed – they are no longer supported by embla\n\n```python\n#  ❌ 1.x – embla options passed as props no longer works in 2.x\ndmc.Carousel(loop=True,  dragFree=True,  align=\"start\")\n\n# ✅ 2.x – use emblaOptions to pass options to embla\ndmc.Carousel({ \"loop\": True, \"dragFree\": True, \"align\": 'start' })\n```\n\n\n#### Image No longer has `flex:0` as a default style\n\n```python\n  # ✅ Add back flex:0 style if needed\ndmc.Image(src=logo, h=40, flex=0)\n\n```\n\n####  New DatePicker\n\nA new `DatePicker` component has been added — this is a standalone calendar (no input field), matching Mantine's upstream\ncomponent.\n\nNote that in v0.15.0, the original `DatePicker` was renamed to `DatePickerInput` to align with Mantine’s naming.\n\nIf you are migrating from DMC < 0.15.0 and your app used `dmc.DatePicker` update it to use `dmc.DatePickerInput`\n\n#### New NotificationContainer component\n\nNotifications are now handled by a single component: `NotificationContainer`. This replaces the previous\n`NotificationProvider` + `Notification` approach with one that is more aligned with Mantine's implementation. Also, there is\nnow direct access to Mantine's  Notification API in clientside callbacks. \n\nPlease see the new [Notification docs](/components/notification) for more details.\n\nThe `NotificationProvider` and `Notification` components are now deprecated and will be removed in a future major release.\nPlease see the [Notification Migration Guide](/migration-notifications) for a step-by-step guild for updating your apps.\n\n\n\n#### Portal reuseTargetNode\n`reuseTargetNode` prop of `Portal` component is now enabled by default. This option improves performance by reusing the\ntarget node between portal renders, but in some edge cases, it might cause issues with z-index stacking context.\n\nFor more information see the [Mantine Portal documentation.](https://mantine.dev/core/portal/)\n\nIf you experience issues with z-index, change `reuseTargetNode` prop to `False` in `theme`:\n\n\n```python\ndmc.MantineProvider(    \n    theme={\n        \"components\": {\n            \"Portal\": {\n                \"defaultProps\": {\n                    # ✅ Disable reuseTargetNode by default if your application has z-index issues\n                    \"reuseTargetNode\": False,                  \n                },\n            },\n        },\n    }\n)\n```\n\n\n#### Menu data-hovered attribute\n`MenuItem` no longer uses `data-hovered` attribute to indicate hovered state. If you used `data-hovered` in your styles,\nyou need to change it `:hover` and `:focus` selectors instead:\n\n.css files:\n```css\n// ❌ 7.x – styles with `data-hovered`,\n// no longer works in 8.x\n.item {\n  &[data-hovered] {\n    background-color: red;\n  }\n}\n\n// ✅ 8.x – use styles with `:hover` and `:focus`\n.item {\n  &:hover,\n  &:focus {\n    background-color: red;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n### Stylesheets Are Now Included Automatically (DMC ≥ 1.2.0)\n\nAs of `dash-mantine-components >= 1.2.0`, you no longer need to manually include optional stylesheets for components like `DatePicker`, `Carousel`, `CodeHighlight`, or `RichTextEditor`.\n\nThese styles are now bundled automatically — making setup faster and simpler.\n\n#### Still using an older version?\n\nIf you're working with **DMC < 1.2.0**, you may need to manually include stylesheets like this:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Dash\n\napp = Dash(\n    external_stylesheets=[\n        dmc.styles.CAROUSEL,\n        dmc.styles.CODE_HIGHLIGHT,\n        dmc.styles.NOTIFICATIONS,\n        # or just use dmc.styles.ALL\n    ]\n)\n```\n\nYou can also inspect any style path directly:\n\n```python\nprint(dmc.styles.CODE_HIGHLIGHT)\n# → https://unpkg.com/@mantine/code-highlight@7.x.x/styles.css\n```\n\n\n\n### Migrating from 0.15 to 1.0.0\n\nThis release ensures dash-mantine-components V1 is fully compatible with both Dash 2 and Dash 3.\n**If you are using dash-mantine-components<1.0.0 you must  pin your dash version to < 3.0.0**\n\n#### Breaking Change: Carousel Props\nThe `draggable` and `speed` props have been removed from `Carousel` as they are no longer supported in Embla Carousel V8.\nThese props were functional until DMC 0.14.7, when Embla was upgraded to V8.\n\n#### React 18 \nDash 3.0 now uses react 18 by default.  If your app uses dash>=3.0 it is no longer necessary to set the React version:\n```python\nimport dash\n# not needed with dash>=3.0\ndash._dash_renderer._set_react_version(\"18.2.0\")\n```\n\n### Migrating from 0.14 to 0.15\n\nThe `DatePicker` component has been renamed to `DatePickerInput` to align with the component names of  the upstream\nMantine Library.  We plan to add the Mantine [`DatePicker`](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker/) component in a future release.\n\nWe still expect far fewer breaking changes going forward compared to what you may have experienced in the past. For more details, please see our [Roadmap](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/discussions/377).\n\n\n### Migrating from 0.12 to 0.14\n\n#### Backstory\n\nThere are many breaking changes going from DMC `v0.12` to DMC `v0.14`. The major reason behind this was we jumped from \nunderlying Mantine `v5` to Mantine `v7` and DMC tries to be as aligned with Mantine as possible. \n\nIt's helpful to also refer to the upstream docs as well for a description of breaking changes:\n  - [Mantine V7.0](https://mantine.dev/changelog/7-0-0/)\n  - [Mantine V6.0](https://v6.mantine.dev/changelog/6-0-0/)\n\nThis hard alignment ensures that I can continue developing and maintaining this library alongside my day job. However, \nas per the author of Mantine itself, Mantine is reaching maturity and \nMantine `v8` is supposed to introduce a lot of new features without the cost of API change.\n\nI'd recommend going through the [getting started](/getting-started) page as well.\n\n#### MantineProvider\n\nIt is now mandatory to wrap your app into [MantineProvider](/components/mantineprovider) (of which only one can be there in the app).\nThis component is responsible for providing theme to all DMC components.\n\nDark theme is changed like this now:\n\n  ```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n        forceColorScheme=\"dark\",\n        theme={...}\n)\n```\n\nMantine provides some better way to manage color themes in your app, but they are yet to be made available in DMC.\n\n#### React 18+ only\n\nStarting with `v0.14`, DMC will need REACT 18. You can ensure that in two ways:\n\n#### In the app settings\n\n```python\nimport dash\n\n# add this before creating app object\ndash._dash_renderer._set_react_version('18.2.0')\n\napp = Dash(__name__)\n```\n\n#### Environment variable\n\n```bash\nREACT_VERSION=18.2.0 python app.py\n```\n\n#### Required StyleSheets\n\nExcept styling for core elements, the styling for components like `CodeHighlight`, `DatePicker`, `Carousel`, etc. have to be \nincluded by the user.\n\n```python\nfrom dash import Dash\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n# below covers all the stylesheets, you can pick as per your need.\nstylesheets = [\n    dmc.styles.DATES,\n    dmc.styles.CODE_HIGHLIGHT,\n    dmc.styles.CHARTS,\n    dmc.styles.CAROUSEL,\n    dmc.styles.NOTIFICATIONS,\n    dmc.styles.NPROGRESS,\n]\n\napp = Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=stylesheets)\n```\nOr, include all the stylesheets like this:\n\n```python\napp = Dash(external_stylesheets=dmc.styles.ALL)\n```\n\n#### Missing components\n\n- `Chip` and `ChipGroup` components are not working as expected when ported over in dash. It will be worked on as part of subsequent releases.\n- `TransferList` is no longer available. You might benefit from [AIO based TransferList component](https://community.plotly.com/t/dash-mantine-components-0-14-1/83865/18?u=snehilvj) created by a community member.\n**update** `Chip` and `ChipGroup` are available as of 0.14.6\n\n#### Creatable option in Select and MultiSelect\n\n`creatable` prop has been removed from `Select` and `MultiSelect`. However, [TagsInput](/components/tagsinput) can be used to emulate\nthe same functionality as `MultiSelect` with `creatable` prop.\n\n#### Left and Right section\n\nComponents that previously had `rightSection` and `icon` props, now use `leftSection` instead of `icon`. Example of Button sections:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Button(\n    \"GitHub\",\n    leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"radix-icons:github-logo\", width=20),\n    rightSection=dmc.Badge(\"3\", circle=True, color=\"gray\"),\n)\n```\n#### Title\n\n[Title](/components/title) doesn't accept other [Text](/components/text) props like gradient etc. anymore.\n\n#### Progress\n\n[Progress](/components/progress) component now supports compound components pattern. Advanced features that were previously implemented in Progress\nare now supposed to be implemented with compound components instead.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.ProgressRoot(\n    [\n        dmc.ProgressSection(dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Documents\"), value=33, color=\"cyan\"),\n        dmc.ProgressSection(dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Photos\"), value=28, color=\"pink\"),\n        dmc.ProgressSection(dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Others\"), value=15, color=\"orange\"),\n    ],\n    size=\"xl\",\n)\n```\n     Tooltips on Progress are not working as expected for now. Will have to tackle this in the subsequent releases.\n\n#### Table\n\n[Table](/components/table) component changes:\n\n- [Styles API](/styles-api) support\n- It is now required to use `dmc` compound components instead of `html` table ones: `dmc.TableTr`, `dmc.TableTd`, etc.\n- New props: `borderColor`, `withRowBorders`, `stripedColor`, `highlightOnHoverColor`\n- `withBorder` prop was renamed to `withTableBorder`\n- `fontSize` prop was removed, use `fz` [style prop](/style-props) instead\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nelements = [\n    {\"position\": 6, \"mass\": 12.011, \"symbol\": \"C\", \"name\": \"Carbon\"},\n    {\"position\": 7, \"mass\": 14.007, \"symbol\": \"N\", \"name\": \"Nitrogen\"},\n    {\"position\": 39, \"mass\": 88.906, \"symbol\": \"Y\", \"name\": \"Yttrium\"},\n    {\"position\": 56, \"mass\": 137.33, \"symbol\": \"Ba\", \"name\": \"Barium\"},\n    {\"position\": 58, \"mass\": 140.12, \"symbol\": \"Ce\", \"name\": \"Cerium\"},\n]\n\nrows = [\n    dmc.TableTr(\n        [\n            dmc.TableTd(element[\"position\"]),\n            dmc.TableTd(element[\"name\"]),\n            dmc.TableTd(element[\"symbol\"]),\n            dmc.TableTd(element[\"mass\"]),\n        ]\n    )\n    for element in elements\n]\n\nhead = dmc.TableThead(\n    dmc.TableTr(\n        [\n            dmc.TableTh(\"Element Position\"),\n            dmc.TableTh(\"Element Name\"),\n            dmc.TableTh(\"Symbol\"),\n            dmc.TableTh(\"Atomic Mass\"),\n        ]\n    )\n)\nbody = dmc.TableTbody(rows)\ncaption = dmc.TableCaption(\"Some elements from periodic table\")\n\ncomponent = dmc.Table([head, body, caption])\n```\n#### Group\n\n[Group](/components/group) component changes:\n\n- `position` prop was renamed to `justify` – it now supports all `justify-content` values\n- `spacing` prop was renamed to `gap`\n\n#### Button\n\n[Button](/components/button) changes\n\n- `compact` prop was removed, use `size='compact-xx'` instead\n- `leftIcon` and `rightIcon` props were renamed to `leftSection` and `rightSection`\n- `uppercase` prop was removed, use `tt` [style prop](/style-props) instead\n- `loaderPosition` prop was removed, Loader is now always rendered in the center to prevent layout shifts\n\n#### AppShell (renamed Navbar, Aside, Header, Footer, Main)\n\n[AppShell](/components/appshell) component is more feature rich now and has undergone following changes:\n\n- `AppShell` now uses compound components pattern: `dmc.AppShellNavbar`, `dmc.AppShellAside`, `dmc.AppShellHeader`, `dmc.AppShellFooter`, and `dmc.AppShellMain`.\n- `AppShell` now supports animations when navbar/aside are opened/closed\n- `AppShell` no longer supports `fixed` prop – all components have `position: fixed` styles, static positioning is no longer supported\n\n#### SimpleGrid\n\n[SimpleGrid](/components/simplegrid) now uses object format to define grid breakpoints and spacing, it works the same way as [style props](/style-props).\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\nstyle = {\n    \"border\": f\"1px solid var(--mantine-primary-color-filled)\",\n    \"textAlign\": \"center\",\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.SimpleGrid(\n    cols={\"base\": 1, \"sm\": 2, \"lg\": 5},\n    spacing={\"base\": 10, \"sm\": \"xl\"},\n    verticalSpacing={\"base\": \"md\", \"sm\": \"xl\"},\n    children=[\n        html.Div(\"1\", style=style),\n        html.Div(\"2\", style=style),\n        html.Div(\"3\", style=style),\n        html.Div(\"4\", style=style),\n        html.Div(\"5\", style=style),\n    ],\n)\n```\n#### Grid\n\n[Grid](/components/grid) now uses object format in `gutter`, `offset`, `span` and `order` props, all props now work the same way as [style props](/style-props).\n\n- `Col` component has been renamed to `GridCol`\n\n#### Image\n\n[Image](/components/image) component changes:\n\n- `caption` prop is no longer available \n- `width` and `height` props are replaced with `w` and `h` [style props](/style-props)\n- Placeholder functionality was replaced with fallback image\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Image(\n    radius=\"md\",\n    src=None,\n    h=200,\n    fallbackSrc=\"https://placehold.co/600x400?text=Placeholder\",\n)\n```\n#### Notification\n\n`NotificationsProvider` has been renamed to `NotificationProvider`.\n`disallowClose` is no longer available.  Use `withCloseButton`\n\n#### Prism\n\n`Prism` has been replaced by [CodeHighlight](/components/code-highlight).\n\n#### MediaQuery\n\nMediaQuery has been removed. You can use CSS or `visibleFrom` and `hiddenFrom` props.\n\nAll DMC components now support `hiddenFrom` and `visibleFrom` props. These props accept breakpoint (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`) \nand hide the component when viewport width is less than or greater than the specified breakpoint.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Hidden from sm\", hiddenFrom=\"sm\", color=\"orange\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Visible from sm\", visibleFrom=\"sm\", color=\"cyan\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Visible from md\", visibleFrom=\"md\", color=\"pink\"),\n    ],\n    justify=\"center\",\n)\n```"

    "content": "\n\n## Notifications Migration Guide  \nThis page helps you migrate from the NotificationProvider to the NotificationContainer  \nCategory: Releases  \n\nStarting in `dash-mantine-components` v2.0.0, the notification system has been redesigned to align more closely\nwith Mantine’s implementation. The `NotificationProvider` and `Notification` components are now deprecated and\nwill be removed in a future release. \n\nSee the [new Notification documentation](components/notification) for more details.\n\nNeed to reference the old version? Visit the [DMC 1.3.0 Notification docs](https://dmc-docs-1-3.onrender.com/components/notification) \n\n### Key Changes\n\n* Old approach:\n\n  * Add `NotificationProvider` to your app layout.\n  * Include a separate output container, such as `html.Div`.\n  * Return `Notification` components from callbacks to show messages.\n\n* New approach:\n\n  * Add a single `NotificationContainer` inside your `MantineProvider`.\n  * Use the `sendNotifications` prop to show or update notifications.\n  * Use the `hideNotifications`, `clean`, and `cleanQueue` props to use the `hide`, `clean` and `cleanQueue` features.\n  * Use the `appNotifications` API for client-side interactions.\n\n### Updating Your Code\n\nBefore (deprecated):\n\n```python\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    [\n        dmc.NotificationProvider(),\n        html.Div(id=\"notifications-output\"),  \n        # other components\n    ]\n)\n```\n\nAfter (recommended):\n\n```python\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider([\n    dmc.NotificationContainer(id=\"notification-container\"),\n    # other components...\n])\n```\n\n### Show Notifications\n\nBefore:\n\n```python\n@app.callback(\n    Output(\"notification-output\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"trigger-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\ndef show_notification(n_clicks):\n    if n_clicks:\n        return dmc.Notification(\n            title=\"Notification\",\n            message=\"This is a notification.\",\n            color=\"blue\",\n            action=\"show\",\n            id=\"notify\"\n        )\n    return None\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```python\n@app.callback(\n    Output(\"notification-container\", \"sendNotifications\"),\n    Input(\"trigger-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\ndef show_notification(n_clicks):\n    if n_clicks:\n        return [{\n            \"action\": \"show\",\n            \"title\": \"Notification\",\n            \"message\": \"This is a notification.\",\n            \"color\": \"blue\",\n            \"id\": \"notify\"\n        }]\n    return []\n```\n\n### Update Notifications\n\nBefore:\n\n```python\n@app.callback(\n    Output(\"notification-output\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"trigger-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\ndef show_notification(n_clicks):\n    if n_clicks:\n        return dmc.Notification(\n            title=\"Notification\",\n            message=\"This is an updated notification.\",\n            color=\"blue\",\n            action=\"update\",\n            id=\"notify\"\n        )\n    return None\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```python\n@app.callback(\n    Output(\"notification-container\", \"sendNotifications\"),\n    Input(\"trigger-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\ndef show_notification(n_clicks):\n    if n_clicks:\n        return [{\n            \"action\": \"update\",\n            \"title\": \"Notification\",\n            \"message\": \"This is an updated notification.\",\n            \"color\": \"blue\",\n            \"id\": \"notify\"\n        }]\n    return []\n```\n\n### Hide Notifications\n\nBefore:\n\n```python\n@app.callback(\n    Output(\"notification-output\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"trigger-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\ndef hide_notification(n_clicks):\n    if n_clicks:\n        return dmc.Notification(\n            action=\"hide\",\n            id=\"notify\"\n        )\n    return None\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```python\n@app.callback(\n    Output(\"notification-container\", \"hideNotifications\"),\n    Input(\"trigger-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\ndef hide_notification(n_clicks):\n    if n_clicks:\n        return [\"notify\"] #ids  of notifications to hide\n    return []\n```\n\n### Clean\n\nBefore:\n\n```python\n@app.callback(\n    Output(\"notification-output\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"trigger-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\ndef clean_notification(n_clicks):\n    if n_clicks:\n        return dmc.Notification(\n            action=\"clean\"\n        )\n    return None\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```python\n@app.callback(\n    Output(\"notification-container\", \"clean\"),\n    Input(\"trigger-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\ndef clean_notification(n_clicks):\n    if n_clicks:\n        return True\n    return no_update\n```\n\n### Clean Queue\n\nBefore:\n\n```python\n@app.callback(\n    Output(\"notification-output\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"trigger-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\ndef cleanQueue_notification(n_clicks):\n    if n_clicks:\n        return dmc.Notification(\n            action=\"cleanQueue\"\n        )\n    return None\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```python\n@app.callback(\n    Output(\"notification-container\", \"cleanQueue\"),\n    Input(\"trigger-button\", \"n_clicks\"),\n)\ndef cleanQueue_notification(n_clicks):\n    if n_clicks:\n        return True\n    return no_update\n```\n\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n\n\n#### NotificationProvider\n\n- id (string;

See our [Migration Guide](/migration) for step-by-step instructions for updating your apps.\n\n### What's New\n\n*  **Functions as Props** – Use JavaScript functions from Python to customize charts, sliders, filters, dropdowns, and more\n*  **Simplified Notifications** – Use `NotificationContainer` and the Mantine API directly in clientside callbacks\n*  **New DatePicker** – A calendar-only component with full support for multi-date, ranges, and custom disabled logic\n*  **New TimePicker & TimeGrid** – Better time selection with dropdowns, 12/24h formats, and predefined slots\n*  **Submenus in Menu** – New nested menu support\n*  **Carousel API updates** – Now uses `emblaOptions` for full alignment with Mantine\n*  **Component improvements** – Updated `Switch`, better dropdown behavior, and more!\n\n\n### New Functions as Props\nYou can now pass JavaScript functions to DMC components using:\n```python\n{\"function\": \"yourFunctionName\"}\n```\nThis enables advanced use cases like:\n\n- Custom chart tooltips and axis value formatting\n- Smart search filters for Select and MultiSelect\n- Custom option renderers with full React components\n- Custom Slider scales and labels\n- Dynamically disabled calendar dates\n\nYou can even pass options from Python:\n```python\n{\"function\": \"formatTemp\", \"options\": {\"unit\": \"F\"}}\n```\nFunctions live in `/assets/*.js` under the global `window.dashMantineFunctions` object.\n\n🤔 Don’t know JavaScript? No problem!\nThe docs include examples of how to use AI to convert Python functions to JavaScript, with prompt templates to help you get reliable results every time:\n\nSee the new [Functions As Props docs](/functions-as-props)\n\n\n#### Example: Custom Slider Label + Scale\n```python\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.Slider(\n        min=2,\n        max=30,\n        step=1,\n        value=10,\n        scale={\"function\": \"getScale\"},\n        labelAlwaysOn=True,\n        label={\"function\": \"valueLabelFormat\"}\n    ),\n    dmc.RangeSlider(\n        mt=50,\n        min=2,\n        max=30,\n        step=1,\n        value=[10, 20],\n        scale={\"function\": \"getScale\"},\n        labelAlwaysOn=True,\n        label={\"function\": \"valueLabelFormat\"}\n    )\n])\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.getScale = (v) => Math.pow(2, v);\n\ndmcfuncs.valueLabelFormat = (value) => {\n  const units = ['KB', 'MB', 'GB', 'TB'];\n  let unitIndex = 0;\n  let scaledValue = value;\n\n  while (scaledValue >= 1024 && unitIndex < units.length - 1) {\n    unitIndex += 1;\n    scaledValue /= 1024;\n  }\n\n  return `${scaledValue} ${units[unitIndex]}`;\n};\n```\n\n#### Example: DatePicker: Disable All Except Fridays\n```python\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n# makes dayjs available\n#app = Dash(exteral_scripts=[\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dayjs/1.10.8/dayjs.min.js\"])\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    dmc.DatePicker(\n        value=\"2024-11-08\",\n        defaultDate=\"2024-11-01\",\n        disabledDates={\"function\": \"excludeDate\"},\n        m=\"lg\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.excludeDate = function(dateStr) {\n   const date = dayjs(dateStr, \"YYYY-MM-DD\");\n   return date.isValid() && date.day() !== 5;\n}\n```\n\n#### Example: MultiSelect: Components in the Dropdown\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nusers_data = {\n    \"Emily Johnson\": {\n        \"image\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/avatars/avatar-7.png\",\n        \"email\": \"emily92@gmail.com\",\n    },\n    \"Ava Rodriguez\": {\n        \"image\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/avatars/avatar-8.png\",\n        \"email\": \"ava_rose@gmail.com\",\n    },\n    \"Olivia Chen\": {\n        \"image\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/avatars/avatar-4.png\",\n        \"email\": \"livvy_globe@gmail.com\",\n    },\n    \"Ethan Barnes\": {\n        \"image\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/avatars/avatar-1.png\",\n        \"email\": \"ethan_explorer@gmail.com\",\n    },\n    \"Mason Taylor\": {\n        \"image\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/avatars/avatar-2.png\",\n        \"email\": \"mason_musician@gmail.com\",\n    },\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    data=list(users_data.keys()),\n    label=\"Employees of the month\",\n    placeholder=\"Search for employee\",\n    maxDropdownHeight=300,\n    searchable=True,\n    hidePickedOptions=True,\n    renderOption={\n        \"function\": \"renderUserOption\",\n        \"options\": {\"users\": users_data},\n    },\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\nvar dmc = window.dash_mantine_components;\n\ndmcfuncs.renderUserOption = function ({ option }, { users }) {\n  const user = users[option.value];\n\n  return React.createElement(\n    dmc.Group,\n    { gap: \"sm\" },\n    React.createElement(dmc.Avatar, {\n      key: \"avatar\",\n      src: user.image,\n      size: 36,\n      radius: \"xl\",\n    }),\n    React.createElement(\n      \"div\",\n      { key: \"text-block\" },\n      React.createElement(dmc.Text, { size: \"sm\", key: \"name\" }, option.value),\n      React.createElement(dmc.Text, {\n        size: \"xs\",\n        opacity: 0.5,\n        key: \"email\",\n        children: user.email,\n      })\n    )\n  );\n};\n```\n\n\n### New NotificationContainer component\n\nNotifications are now handled by a single component: `NotificationContainer`.\n\nThis new approach replaces the previous  `NotificationProvider` + `Notification` pattern with one that’s simpler, more\nconsistent with Mantine, and resolves a number of issues from earlier versions.\n\nAlso, there is now direct access to Mantine's  Notification API in clientside callbacks. \n\nThanks to @BSd3v for contributing this new component.\n\nPlease see the new [Notification docs](/components/notification) for more details.\n\n\n### New Menu with Sub Menus\n\n```python\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\nmenu = dmc.Menu(\n    width=200,\n    position=\"bottom-start\",\n    children=[\n        dmc.MenuTarget(\n            dmc.Button(\"Toggle Menu\")\n        ),\n        dmc.MenuDropdown([\n            dmc.MenuItem(\"Dashboard\"),\n\n            dmc.SubMenu([\n                dmc.SubMenuTarget(\n                    dmc.SubMenuItem(\"Products\")\n                ),\n                dmc.SubMenuDropdown([\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"All products\"),\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Categories\"),\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Tags\"),\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Attributes\"),\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Shipping classes\"),\n                ])\n            ]),\n\n            dmc.SubMenu([\n                dmc.SubMenuTarget(\n                    dmc.SubMenuItem(\"Orders\")\n                ),\n                dmc.SubMenuDropdown([\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Open\"),\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Completed\"),\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Cancelled\"),\n                ])\n            ]),\n\n            dmc.SubMenu([\n                dmc.SubMenuTarget(\n                    dmc.SubMenuItem(\"Settings\")\n                ),\n                dmc.SubMenuDropdown([\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Profile\"),\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Security\"),\n                    dmc.MenuItem(\"Notifications\"),\n                ])\n            ]),\n        ])\n    ]\n)\n\ncomponent=dmc.Center(menu)\n```\n\n\n### New TimePicker Component\n\nNew `TimePicker` component is an alternative to `TimeInput` that offers more features. It supports 24-hour and\n12-hour formats, dropdown with hours, minutes and seconds, and more.\n\nWith Dropdown:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    gap=50,\n    mb=60,\n    children=[\n        dmc.TimePicker(\n            label=\"Enter time (24h format)\",\n            withSeconds=True,\n            withDropdown=True\n        ),\n        dmc.TimePicker(\n            label=\"Enter time (12h format)\",\n            withSeconds=True,\n            withDropdown=True,\n            format=\"12h\"\n        ),\n    ],\n)\n```\nWith presets:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.TimePicker(\n    label=\"Enter a time\",\n    withDropdown=True,\n    maxDropdownContentHeight=300,\n    presets = [\n        {\"label\": 'Morning', \"values\": ['06:00:00', '08:00:00', '10:00:00']},\n        {\"label\": 'Afternoon', \"values\": ['12:00:00', '14:00:00', '16:00:00']},\n        {\"label\": 'Evening', \"values\": ['18:00:00', '20:00:00', '22:00:00']},\n    ],\n    mb=120,\n)\n```\n### DateTimePicker component changes\n`DateTimePicker` component now uses `TimePicker` under the hood instead of `TimeInput`. You can now use all \n`TimePicker` features with `DateTimePicker` component.\n\nThe  `timeInputProps` is no longer available.  To pass props down to the underlying `TimePicker` you need to use `timePickerProps` prop.\n\nExample of enabling dropdown and setting 12h format for time picker:\n\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.DateTimePicker(\n    label=\"Pick date and time\",\n    placeholder=\"Pick Date and time\",\n    timePickerProps={\n        \"withDropdown\": True,\n        \"popoverProps\": { \"withinPortal\": False },\n        \"format\": '12h',\n      }\n)\n```\n### New TimeGrid component\nNew `TimeGrid` component allows to capture time value from the user with a predefined set of time slots:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.TimeGrid(\n        timeRangeData={\"startTime\": \"10:00\", \"endTime\": \"21:00\", \"interval\": \"01:00\"},\n        withSeconds=False,\n        simpleGridProps={\n            \"type\": \"container\",\n            \"cols\": {\"base\": 1, \"180px\": 2, \"320px\": 3},\n            \"spacing\": \"xs\",\n        },\n        value=\"10:00:00\",\n        id=\"time-grid\"\n    ),\n    dmc.Text(id=\"time-grid-out\")\n])\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"time-grid-out\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"time-grid\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update(value):\n    return f\"You selected: {value}\"\n```\n### New DatePicker component  \n\nWe've added a new `DatePicker` — a calendar-only component with no input field. It's the base calendar used in components \nlike `DateInput`, `DatePickerInput`, and `DateTimePicker`. Any configuration you can apply to `DatePicker` — such as\nmultiple selection, min/max dates, week numbers, or disabled dates — can also be used in those components.\n\n[Read the full DatePicker docs →](/components/datepicker)\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Input, Output, html, callback\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.DatePicker(id=\"date-picker\"),\n    dmc.Text(id=\"selected-date-picker\", mt=10),\n], align=\"center\")\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"selected-date-picker\", \"children\"), Input(\"date-picker\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update_output(d):\n    return f\"You selected {d}\"\n```\n### Popover Hide detached\n\nUse `hideDetached` prop to configure how the dropdown behaves when the target element is hidden with styles \n(`display: none, visibility: hidden,` etc.), removed from the DOM, or when the target element is scrolled out of the viewport.\n\nBy default, `hideDetached` is enabled – the dropdown is hidden with the target element. You can change this behavior\nwith `hideDetached=False`. To see the difference, try to scroll the container that holds the Popover components:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box(\n    style={\"border\": \"1px solid var(--mantine-color-dimmed)\", \"overflow\": \"auto\"},\n    p=\"xl\",\n    w=400,\n    h=200,\n    children=[\n        dmc.Box(\n            w=1000,\n            h=400,\n            children=dmc.Group(\n                [\n                    dmc.Popover(\n                        opened=True,\n                        width=\"target\",\n                        position=\"bottom\",\n                        closeOnClickOutside=False,\n                        children=[\n                            dmc.PopoverTarget(\n                                dmc.Button(\"Toggle popover\")\n                            ),\n                            dmc.PopoverDropdown(\"This popover dropdown is hidden when detached\"),\n                        ],\n                    ),\n                    dmc.Popover(\n                        opened=True,\n                        width=\"target\",\n                        position=\"bottom\",\n                        closeOnClickOutside=False,\n                        hideDetached=False,\n                        children=[\n                            dmc.PopoverTarget(\n                                dmc.Button(\"Toggle popover\")\n                            ),\n                            dmc.PopoverDropdown(\"This popover dropdown is visible when detached\"),\n                        ],\n                    ),\n                ]\n            ),\n        )\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n\n\n### Carousel changes\nThe following props are removed.  They now need to be passed to embla using the `emblaOptions` prop\n- `loop`\n- `align`\n- `slidesToScroll`\n- `dragFree`\n- `inViewThreshold`\n- `skipSnaps`\n- `containScroll`\n\n```python\n#  ❌ 1.x – embla options passed as props no longer works in 2.x\ndmc.Carousel(loop=True,  dragFree=True,  align=\"start\")\n\n# ✅ 2.x – use emblaOptions to pass options to embla\ndmc.Carousel({ \"loop\": True, \"dragFree\": True, \"align\": 'start' })\n```\nAlso, the `speed` and `draggable` props were removed – they are no longer supported by embla\n\n### Switch withThumbIndicator\nSwitch component styles were updated to include indicator inside the thumb. You can change it by setting `withThumbIndicator` prop:\n\n### Other changes\n- [CodeHighlight](/components/code-highlight) - To reduce the bundle size only the top 10 languages are supported.  If you would like to include other, please open an issue on our GitHub\n- DatesProvider timezone -DatesProvider component no longer supports timezone option – all Mantine dates components now use strings in YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss format as values and do not contain timezone information.\n- See the [Mantine Changelog](https://mantine.dev/changelog/8-0-0/#other-changes) for other changes.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Start\n\nJust a reminder...\n\n* If you're using Dash ≥ 3.0.0, you no longer need to set the React version manually.\n* If you're using DMC ≥ 1.2.0, there's no need to include additional stylesheets like `dmc.styles.ALL`.\n\nHere’s a minimal app to get started:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Dash\n\napp = Dash()\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    dmc.Alert(\n        \"Welcome to Dash Mantine Components\",\n        title=\"Hello!\",\n        color=\"violet\",\n    )\n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```"

    "content": "\n\n## Version 2.1.0  \nRelease announcement for Dash Mantine Components v2.1.0  \nCategory: Releases  \n\nReleased July 1, 2025\n\n### What's New\n \n* New `ModalStack` and `DrawerStack` components\n* Function support expanded across more components and props\n* Custom rendering options for calendar and tree views\n* UI refinements and new props across the board\n* Based on [Mantine 8.1.2](https://mantine.dev/changelog/8-1-0/)\n\n\n### New ModalStack and DrawerStack components\n\nUse [ModalStack](/components/modal) or [DrawerStack](/components/drawer) to render and manage multiple modals or drawers at once. These components handle focus, z-index stacking, and Escape key closing automatically.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html, Output, Input, callback, ctx, no_update\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center([\n    dmc.ModalStack(\n        id=\"modal-stack\",\n        children=[\n            dmc.ManagedModal(\n                id=\"delete-page\",\n                title=\"Delete this page?\",\n                children=[\n                    dmc.Text(\"Are you sure you want to delete this page?

The value is a dictionary using keys `'previous'`, `'next'`, and `'level'`.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.DatePicker(\n    value=\"2025-02-01\",\n    headerControlsOrder = ['level', 'previous', 'next'],\n    styles = {\n        \"calendarHeaderLevel\": {\n            \"justifyContent\": 'flex-start',\n            \"paddingInlineStart\": 8,\n        },\n    }\n)\n```\n### Slider Domain prop\n[Slider](/components/slider) component now supports `domain` prop that allows setting the possible range of values independently of the min and max values:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Slider(\n    domain=[0, 100],\n      min=10,\n      max=90,\n      value=25,\n      marks=[\n        { \"value\": 10, \"label\": 'min' },\n        { \"value\": 90, \"label\": 'max' },\n      ]\n)\n```\n### RangeSlider pushOnOverlap prop\n[RangeSlider](/components/range-slider) component now supports `pushOnOverlap` prop that defines whether the slider should push the overlapping thumb when the user drags it.\n\nThis examples shows  `pushOnOverlap=False`  (The default is `True`)\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.RangeSlider(\n    pushOnOverlap=False,\n    minRange=20,\n    value=[25, 65]\n)\n```\n### Additional Props Now Support Functions\n\nFunction props were introduced in DMC v2.0, allowing you to pass JavaScript functions to certain component props for dynamic formatting, styling, and rendering.\n\nIn v2.1, this support has been expanded to include even more components and props — such as  calendar inputs, AutoComplete, and Tree.\n\nYou can now customize things like:\n\n* Highlighting or disabling specific dates, months, or years in the calendar, month and year pickers\n* Modifying how AutoComplete options are rendered or filtered\n* Fully controlling how each node in a Tree is displayed\n\nFor a complete list of newly supported function props, [see the table in the docs](/functions-as-props#supported-props-in-v2-1).\nAnd for guidance on writing these functions — or generating them from Python using AI — see the [Functions as Props docs](/functions-as-props).\n\n#### Example: Add an indicator to a calendar day\n\n```python\nfrom dash import Dash\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\n# Adding dayjs as external script to make it available to the function\n# app = Dash(external_scripts=[\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dayjs/1.10.8/dayjs.min.js\"])\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.DatePicker(\n    id=\"custom-day-render\",\n    renderDay={\"function\": \"highlightSixteenthWithDot\"}\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\nvar dmc = window.dash_mantine_components;\nvar dayjs = window.dayjs;\n\ndmcfuncs.highlightSixteenthWithDot = function (dateStr) {\n  const day = dayjs(dateStr).date();\n\n  return React.createElement(\n    dmc.Indicator,\n    {\n      size: 9,\n      color: \"red\",\n      offset: -5,\n      disabled: day !== 16, // displays indicator only on the the 16th doy of the month\n    },\n    React.createElement(\"div\", null, day)\n  );\n};\n```\n\n\n#### Example: Add props to year and month control\n\nCustomize the year, month, and day controls using `getYearControlProps`, `getMonthControlProps`, and `getDayProps`. Each function receives a date and returns props to apply to that control.\n\nThis example:\n\n* Highlights every Friday the 13th using `getDayProps`\n* Disables June and highlights February using `getMonthControlProps` (In the month picker)\n* Disables 2026 and highlights 2025 using `getYearControlProps`  (In the year picker)\n\n\n```python\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n# Adding dayjs as external script to make it available to the function\n# app = Dash(external_scripts=[\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dayjs/1.10.8/dayjs.min.js\"])\n\ncomponent = dmc.DatePicker(\n    defaultDate=\"2025-06-01\",\n    getDayProps={\"function\": \"highlightFriday13\"},\n    getYearControlProps={\"function\": \"yearControlProps\"},\n    getMonthControlProps={\"function\": \"monthControlProps\"},\n    my=\"lg\"\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\n// dayjs is loaded globally via Dash external_scripts.\n// For details, see DatesProvider docs: https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/components/datesprovider\nvar dayjs = window.dayjs;\n\ndmcfuncs.highlightFriday13 = function (dateStr) {\n  const d = dayjs(dateStr);\n\n  if (d.day() === 5 && d.date() === 13) {\n    return {\n      style: {\n        backgroundColor: 'var(--mantine-color-red-filled)',\n        color: 'var(--mantine-color-white)',\n      },\n    };\n  }\n\n  return {};\n};\n\ndmcfuncs.yearControlProps = function (dateStr) {\n  const d = dayjs(dateStr);\n  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();\n\n  if (d.year() === currentYear) {\n    return {\n      style: {\n        color: 'var(--mantine-color-blue-filled)',\n        fontWeight: 700,\n      },\n    };\n  }\n\n  if (d.year() === currentYear + 1) {\n    return { disabled: true };\n  }\n\n  return {};\n};\n\ndmcfuncs.monthControlProps = function (dateStr) {\n  const d = dayjs(dateStr);\n\n  if (d.month() === 1) {\n    return {\n      style: {\n        color: 'var(--mantine-color-blue-filled)',\n        fontWeight: 700,\n      },\n    };\n  }\n\n  if (d.month() === 5) {\n    return { disabled: true };\n  }\n\n  return {};\n};\n```\n\n#### Example:  Custom Rendering of Tree component\n\nYou can fully control how each node is rendered in the [Tree](/components/tree) component using the `renderNode` function. This allows \ncustom icons, layout, or complex styling beyond the built-in options.\n\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nimport dash_iconify  # required in order to use DashIconify in the renderNode function\nfrom .data import data\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Tree(\n    data=data,\n    renderNode={\"function\": \"myLeaf\"},\n    expanded=[\n        \"node_modules\",\n        \"node_modules/react\",\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\n\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.myLeaf = function (payload) {\n  const dmc = window.dash_mantine_components;\n  const iconify = window.dash_iconify;\n\n  function getIcon(name, isFolder, expanded) {\n    const size = 14;\n\n    if (name.endsWith('package.json')) {\n      return React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, {\n        icon: 'logos:npm-icon',\n        width: size,\n        height: size\n      });\n    }\n\n    if (\n      name.endsWith('.ts') ||\n      name.endsWith('.tsx') ||\n      name.endsWith('tsconfig.json')\n    ) {\n      return React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, {\n        icon: 'logos:typescript-icon',\n        width: size,\n        height: size\n      });\n    }\n\n    if (name.endsWith('.css')) {\n      return React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, {\n        icon: 'vscode-icons:file-type-css',\n        width: size,\n        height: size\n      });\n    }\n\n    if (isFolder) {\n      return React.createElement(iconify.DashIconify, {\n        icon: expanded ? 'tabler:folder-open' : 'tabler:folder',\n        width: size,\n        height: size,\n        color: '#f59f00' // Mantine yellow-9\n      });\n    }\n\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const { node, expanded, hasChildren, elementProps } = payload;\n\n  return React.createElement(\n    dmc.Group,\n    { key: payload.node.value, gap: 5, ...elementProps },\n    getIcon(node.value, hasChildren, expanded),\n    React.createElement('span', null, node.label)\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### AutoComplete improvements\n\nThanks to first-time contributor @ihor-lazariev for adding the following features in [PR #604](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/pull/604):\n\n* Support for functions in `renderOption` and `filter` props\n* New `clearButtonProps` and `clearable` props\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Autocomplete(\n    label=\"Select with renderOption\",\n    placeholder=\"Select text align\",\n    data=[\n      { \"value\": 'left', \"label\": 'left' },\n      { \"value\": 'center', \"label\": 'center' },\n      { \"value\": 'right', \"label\": 'right' },\n      { \"value\": 'justify', \"label\": 'justify' },\n    ],\n    renderOption={\"function\": \"renderOptionSelect\"},\n    clearable=True\n)\n```\n### Other Changes\n\nSee the [Mantine Changelog](https://mantine.dev/changelog/8-1-0/#other-changes) for more.\n\n* [`presets` for DatePicker](https://mantine.dev/changelog/8-1-0/#datepicker-presets): Adds predefined date ranges next to the calendar\n* [Popover behavior improvements](https://mantine.dev/changelog/8-1-0/#popover-middlewares-improvements): More consistent dropdown positioning with dynamic content\n* All components now support the `bdrs` style prop for border radius\n* `Tooltip` now supports the `autoContrast` prop for improved legibility\n\n\n---\n\n### Quick Start\n\nJust a reminder:\n\n* With Dash ≥ 3.0.0, there’s no need to manually set the React version.\n* With DMC ≥ 1.2.0, you no longer need to include optional stylesheets such as `dmc.styles.ALL`.\n\nHere’s a minimal app to get started:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Dash\n\napp = Dash()\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    dmc.Alert(\n        \"Welcome to Dash Mantine Components\",\n        title=\"Hello!\",\n        color=\"violet\",\n    )\n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```"

Learn more in the \"Functions As Props\" section of this document.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ntoolbar = {\n    \"sticky\": True,\n    \"controlsGroups\": [\n        [\n\n            {\n                \"CustomControl\": {\n                    \"aria-label\": \"Insert Table\",\n                    \"title\": \"Insert Table\",\n                    \"children\": [DashIconify(icon=\"mdi:table-plus\", width=20, height=20)],\n                    \"onClick\": {\"function\": \"insertTable\"},\n                },\n            },\n            {\n                \"CustomControl\": {\n                    \"aria-label\": \"Add Column Before\",\n                    \"title\": \"Add Column Before\",\n                    \"children\": [DashIconify(icon=\"mdi:table-column-plus-before\", width=20, height=20)],\n                    \"onClick\": {\"function\": \"addColumnBefore\"},\n                },\n            },\n            {\n                \"CustomControl\": {\n                    \"aria-label\": \"Delete Column\",\n                    \"title\": \"Delete Column\",\n                    \"children\": [DashIconify(icon=\"mdi:table-column-remove\", width=20, height=20)],\n                    \"onClick\": {\"function\": \"deleteColumn\"},\n                },\n            },\n        ],\n        [\n            \"Bold\",\n            \"Italic\",\n            \"Underline\",\n        ],\n    ],\n}\n\ncomponent = dmc.RichTextEditor(\n    html= '<div>Click controls to insert table, add column before, or delete column</div>',\n    toolbar = toolbar,\n    className=\"rte\"  # applies custom table styles to this component only\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\n\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\ndmcfuncs.insertTable = ({editor}) => {\n    editor?.chain().focus().insertTable({ rows: 5, cols: 3, withHeaderRow: true }).run()\n}\n\ndmcfuncs.addColumnBefore = ({editor}) => {\n    editor?.chain().focus().addColumnBefore().run()\n}\n\ndmcfuncs.deleteColumn= ({editor}) => {\n    editor?.chain().focus().deleteColumn().run()\n}\n```\n\n```css\n.rte :is(table, th, td) {\n    border: 1px solid var(--table-border-color);\n}\n```\n\n \n### Bar value label props\n\n[Bar Chart](/components/barchart) now supports passing props down to [recharts LabelList](https://recharts.org/en-US/api/LabelList) component with `valueLabelProps` prop. \n\nThanks to first time contributor @CGaul for adding this feature in [PR #620](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/pull/620)! \n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom .data import data\n\ncomponent = dmc.BarChart(\n    h=300,\n    dataKey=\"month\",\n    data=data,\n    withBarValueLabel=True,\n    valueLabelProps={\"position\": 'inside', \"fill\": 'white'},\n    withLegend=True,\n    withTooltip=False,\n    series=[\n        {\"name\": \"Smartphones\", \"color\": \"violet.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Laptops\", \"color\": \"blue.6\"},\n        {\"name\": \"Tablets\", \"color\": \"teal.6\"},\n    ],\n    valueFormatter={\"function\": \"formatNumberIntl\"},\n)\n```\n### Styles API attributes\nYou now can pass attributes to inner elements of all components that support [Styles API](/styles-api) with `attributes`\nprop. For example, it can be used to add data attributes for testing purposes:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Button(\n    \"Button with attributes\",\n    attributes={\n        \"root\": { \"data-test-id\": \"root\" },\n        \"label\": { \"data-test-id\": \"label\" },\n        \"inner\": { \"data-test-id\": \"inner\" },\n      },\n)\n```\n### Container grid strategy\n\n [Container](/components/container) now supports `strategy=\"grid\"` prop which enables more features.\n\nDifferences from the default `strategy=\"block\"`:\n\n- Uses `display: grid` instead of `display: block`\n- Does not include default inline padding\n- Does not set `max-width` on the root element (uses grid template columns instead)\n\nFeatures supported by `strategy=\"grid\"`:\n\n- Everything that is supported by `strategy=\"block\"`\n- Children with `data-breakout` attribute take the entire width of the container's parent element\n- Children with `data-container` inside `data-breakout` have the same width as the main grid column\n\nExample of using breakout feature:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Container(\n    [\n        dmc.Box(\"Main Content\", bg=\"var(--mantine-color-indigo-light)\", h=50),\n        html.Div(\n            [\n                \"Breakout\",\n                html.Div(\n                    \"Container inside breakout\",\n                    style={\n                        \"backgroundColor\": \"var(--mantine-color-indigo-filled)\",\n                        \"color\": \"white\",\n                        \"height\": 50,\n                    },\n                    **{\"data-container\": \"\"}\n                ),\n            ],\n            style={\n                \"backgroundColor\": \"var(--mantine-color-indigo-light)\",\n                \"marginTop\": 16,\n            },\n            **{\"data-breakout\": \"\"}\n        ),\n    ],\n    size=500,\n    strategy=\"grid\",\n)\n```\n\n\n### Tooltip Target\n\nNew [Tooltip](/components/tooltip) `target` prop is an alternative to `children`. It accepts a string (selector), an HTML\nelement or a `ref` object with HTML element. Use `target` prop when you do not render tooltip target as JSX element—for\nexample, in a clientside callback.\n\nExample of using target prop with a string selector:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n    dmc.Button(\"Hover me to see tooltip\", id=\"my-target\"),\n    dmc.Tooltip(target=\"#my-target\", label=\"Tooltip over button\")\n])\n```\n### autoSelectOnBlur prop\n\n[Select](/components/select) and [Autocomplete](/components/autocomplete) components now support `autoSelectOnBlur` prop.\nUse it to automatically select the highlighted option when the input loses focus. To see this feature in action: select\nan option with up/down arrows, then click outside the input:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    label=\"Your favorite library:\",\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    placeholder=\"Pick value\",\n    autoSelectOnBlur=True,\n    w=400,\n)\n```\n### clearSearchOnFocus prop\n\nFor searchable [Select](/components/select) components, when `clearSearchOnFocus=True`, the search input will be cleared each time the\nfield gains focus.  This is useful when you want the user to start with an empty search box each time, without having \nto manually delete the existing text.  \n\nThanks @vaughnfuelling1 for the [feature request](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/issues/626)!\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Select(\n    data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    value=\"Pandas\",\n    searchable=True,\n    clearSearchOnFocus=True,\n)\n```\n### Accordion chevronIconSize prop\n- The [Accordion](/components/accordion) default `chevronSize` prop value was changed to `auto` to allow using dynamic icon sizes.\n- The `Accordion` now supports `chevronIconSize` prop to configure size of the default chevron icon.\n\n### New in the Docs\n\n#### New Autocomplete component section\n\n\nUse [Autocomplete](/components/autocomplete) component in the following cases:\n\n- You want to allow user to enter any value\n- You want to display suggestions to the user based on the input value\n- You want to preserve user input on blur if option was not selected from the dropdown\n- `value` and `label` of the option are the same.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Output, Input, html, callback\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Autocomplete(\n            label=\"Your favorite library\",\n            placeholder=\"Pick value or enter anything\",\n            id=\"framework-autocomplete\",\n            data=[\"Pandas\", \"NumPy\", \"TensorFlow\", \"PyTorch\"],\n            mb=10,\n        ),\n        dmc.Text(id=\"autocomplete-value\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n\n@callback(Output(\"autocomplete-value\", \"children\"), Input(\"framework-autocomplete\", \"value\"))\ndef select_value(value):\n    return f\" You selected {value}\"\n```\n#### Layout Overview\n\nThe new [Layout Overview](/layout-overview) section helps you choose the right component for your use case:\n\n* `Grid` – Use when columns have different sizes (for example, first column is 1/3 width, second is 2/3).\n* `SimpleGrid` – Use for equal-width columns.\n* `Group` – Arrange items horizontally.\n* `Stack` – Arrange items vertically.\n* `Flex` – Create both horizontal and vertical flexbox layouts. More flexible than `Group` or `Stack`, but requires more configuration.\n\nThis section also explains the differences between `Container`, `Paper`, and `Box`, and provides an overview of\n`AppShell` for adding headers, footers, navbars, and asides to your app.\n\n\n#### Theming and Style section updates\n\nThe Theming and Styles are now two sections to make the information easier to find.  Plus there is a new\n[Mantine Overview](/mantine-overview) section to help understand the basic features of the Mantine API.\n\n### Patch Release 2.2.1\n - Updates to Mantine 8.2.7\n - Fixes regression where nested `NavLink` did not open on click\n - Fixes `MulitSelect` and `Select` - changes to the `data` and `value` are batched so they only trigger a single callback\n\n### Quick Start\n\nJust a reminder:\n\n* With Dash ≥ 3.0.0, there’s no need to manually set the React version.\n* With DMC ≥ 1.2.0, you no longer need to include optional stylesheets such as `dmc.styles.ALL`.\n\nHere’s a minimal app to get started:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Dash\n\napp = Dash()\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    dmc.Alert(\n        \"Welcome to Dash Mantine Components\",\n        title=\"Hello!\",\n        color=\"violet\",\n    )\n)\n\napp.run(debug=True)\n```"

Try the new direction toggle in the header of these \ndocs — one click and the entire app flips to RTL. Not just the text, but every component adapts. Check out the [sliders](/components/slider)\nin RTL mode, they feel completely natural.\n\nSee the [RTL (right-to-left) direction guide](/rtl)  for details on enabling RTL direction and adding a toggle to your app.\n\n\n```python\napp.layout = dmc.DirectionProvider(\n    dmc.MantineProvider([\n     # your app layout\n     ]),\n    direction=\"rtl\"\n)\n```\n\n### New MiniCalendar component\n\nThe new [MiniCalendar](/components/mini-calendar) component makes it easy to add compact calendars.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.MiniCalendar(\n        defaultDate=\"2025-01-02\",\n        value=\"2025-01-03\",\n        id=\"mini-calendar\"\n    ),\n    dmc.Text(id=\"mini-calendar-date\", m=\"md\")\n])\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"mini-calendar-date\", \"children\"),\n    Input(\"mini-calendar\", \"value\"),\n)\ndef update(d):\n    return f\"You selected: {d}\"\n```\n### Progress vertical orientation\n\n[Progress](/components/progress) now supports vertical orientation:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group([\n    dmc.Progress(value=80, orientation=\"vertical\", h=200),\n\n    dmc.Progress(\n        value=60,\n        color=\"orange\",\n        size=\"xl\",\n        orientation=\"vertical\",\n        h=200,\n        animated=True\n    ),\n\n    dmc.ProgressRoot(\n        size=\"xl\",\n        autoContrast=True,\n        orientation=\"vertical\",\n        h=200,\n        children=[\n            dmc.ProgressSection(\n                value=40,\n                color=\"lime.4\",\n                children=dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Documents\")\n            ),\n            dmc.ProgressSection(\n                value=20,\n                color=\"yellow.4\",\n                children=dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Apps\")\n            ),\n            dmc.ProgressSection(\n                value=20,\n                color=\"cyan.7\",\n                children=dmc.ProgressLabel(\"Other\")\n            )\n        ]\n    )\n])\n```\n### RichTextEditor upgraded to Tiptap V3\n\n[RichTextEditor](/components/richtexteditor) is now built on Tiptap V3 enabling features like  `BackgroundColor`,\n`FontFamily`, `FontSize`, `LineHeight`.\n\nNote: This change has no known breaking changes, but customizations may be affected.  See our [migration guide,](https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/migration) for details.\n  \n\nHere is an example of creating custom buttons to change the font size:\n\n\n```python\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.RichTextEditor(\n    html=\"<p>Change font size with the controls!</p>\",\n    toolbar={\n        \"controlsGroups\": [\n            [\"H1\", \"H2\", \"H3\", \"H4\"],\n            [\n                {\n                    \"CustomControl\": {\n                        \"aria-label\": \"Increase font size\",\n                        \"title\": \"Increase font size\",\n                        \"children\": DashIconify(icon=\"mdi:format-font-size-increase\", width=16),\n                        \"onClick\": {\"function\": \"increaseFontSize\"},\n                    },\n                },\n                {\n                    \"CustomControl\": {\n                        \"aria-label\": \"Decrease font size\",\n                        \"title\": \"Decrease font size\",\n                        \"children\": DashIconify(icon=\"mdi:format-font-size-decrease\", width=16),\n                        \"onClick\": {\"function\": \"decreaseFontSize\"},\n                    },\n                },\n            ],\n         ],\n    },\n)\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar dmcfuncs = window.dashMantineFunctions = window.dashMantineFunctions || {};\n\nfunction changeFontSize(editor, delta) {\n  if (!editor) return;\n  const { from, to } = editor.state.selection;\n  let size = 16; // default\n\n  editor.state.doc.nodesBetween(from, to, (node) => {\n    if (node.isText) {\n      const mark = node.marks.find(m => m.type.name === \"textStyle\");\n      if (mark?.attrs.fontSize) {\n        size = parseInt(mark.attrs.fontSize, 10);\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  const newSize = Math.min(Math.max(size + delta, 8), 72) + \"px\";\n  editor.chain().focus().setFontSize(newSize).run();\n}\n\ndmcfuncs.increaseFontSize = ({ editor }) => changeFontSize(editor, 2);\ndmcfuncs.decreaseFontSize = ({ editor }) => changeFontSize(editor, -2);\n```\n\n### ScrollArea scrollTo prop\n\nThe [ScrollArea](/components/scrollarea), now includes a `scrollTo` prop to control the viewport position.\n\n  * `top` – The vertical position (pixels or percentage string, from '0%' to '100%')\n  * `left` – The horizontal position (pixels or percentage string, from '0%' to '100%')\n  * `behavior` – `auto` (instant) or `smooth` (animated, default)\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import callback, Input, Output, ctx\n\n\ncontent = [\n    dmc.Box([\n        dmc.Title(f\"Section {i}\", order=4, mt=\"sm\", id=f\"section-{i}\"),\n        dmc.Text(\"\"\"\n            Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.\n            Dicta perspiciatis reiciendis voluptate eaque itaque quos.\n            Natus iure tenetur libero, reprehenderit ad, sequi, in aliquam eos\n            necessitatibus expedita delectus veniam culpa!

It’s useful for dimming\neffects, interactive overlays, and custom loading states. You can configure opacity, color, and positioning.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Dash, Input, Output, callback, html\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n        dmc.AspectRatio(\n            ratio=16/9,\n            maw=400,\n            mx=\"auto\",\n            pos=\"relative\",\n            children=[\n                html.Img(\n                    src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantinedev/mantine/master/.demo/images/bg-1.png\",\n                    alt=\"Demo\",\n                ),\n                dmc.Overlay(\n                    id=\"overlay-usage\",\n                    color=\"#000\",\n                    backgroundOpacity=0.85,\n                    style={\"display\": \"block\"}  # Initially visible\n                )\n            ]\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Toggle overlay\",\n            id=\"overlay-toggle-button\",\n            mx=\"auto\",\n            mt=\"lg\",\n            n_clicks=0\n        )\n    ])\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"overlay-usage\", \"style\"),\n    Input(\"overlay-toggle-button\", \"n_clicks\")\n)\ndef toggle_overlay(n_clicks):\n    if n_clicks %2 == 0:\n        return {\"display\": \"block\"}\n    return {\"display\": \"none\"}\n```\n### MultiSelect improvement\n\n[MultiSelect](/components/multiselect) now supports `clearSearchOnChange=False` allowing multiple selectios from the same search query.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.MultiSelect(\n    data=[\"aa\", \"ab\", \"ac\", \"ba\", \"bb\", \"bc\"],\n    value=[\"aa\"],\n    searchable=True,\n    clearSearchOnChange=False\n)\n```\n### Autocomplete debounce prop\n\nThe [Autocomplete](/components/autocomplete) component now supports the [debounce prop.](/debounce) This delays the update of the `value` until\nthe user stops interacting, reducing callback frequency.\n\n### LLMs.txt\nYou can now use LLMs.txt file with Cursor and other IDEs. The file is automatically updated with each release and\nincludes every demo and documentation page from the DMC docs site. It is about 1.6MB. You can find the latest version \nof LLMs.txt and documentation in the  [LLMs](/llms) section."

    "content": "\n\n## Version 2.5.0  \nRelease announcement for Dash Mantine Components v2.5.0  \nCategory: Releases  \n\nJan 26, 2026  \n\nBased on Mantine 8.3.13\n\nSee [Changelog](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/releases/tag/2.5.0)  \n\n\n\n### New TableofContents Component\n\nUse the `TableOfContents` component to display a table of contents similar to the sidebar in these docs. The\ncomponent tracks scroll position and highlights current heading in the list.\n\nCheck out all the new features in the [Table Of Contents docs](/components/table-of-contents).\n\n*This component was added by @deadkex in [PR #513](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/pull/513)*\n\n### Custom DMC components\n\nYou can now build custom Dash components that use Mantine the same way Dash Mantine Components does.\n\nPreviously, custom components built with the standard Dash component template had to bundle their own copy of Mantine.\nBecause of this, they could not access the `MantineProvider` used by DMC, which meant themes, styles, and context did\nnot work as expected.\n\nDMC now exports `MantineHooks` and `MantineCore`, allowing custom components to use the same Mantine hooks, utilities,\nand context as the built-in components. This enables a wide range of custom components, such as building advanced `Select`\nor `MultiSelect` on top of Mantine’s [Combobox](https://mantine.dev/core/combobox/), while keeping theme and behavior consistent inside a Dash app.\n\nFor examples and step-by-step instructions, see the custom DMC components in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dmc_custom_components).\n\n*This feature was added by @BSd3v in [PR# 653](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/pull/653)*  \n\n### Improved typing\n\nThe Python types for DMC components have been improved to better reflect supported props and values. This provides more\naccurate type hints, better autocomplete, and clearer static checking in editors like VS Code and PyCharm.\n\n\n### New in the docs:  DatePicker presets\n\nThis feature has been available since dash-mantine-components==2.1.0, but was just added to the documentation thanks\nto first time contributor [@EstanVW25](https://github.com/snehilvj/dmc-docs/pull/280)\n\n\n[DatePicker](https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/components/datepicker#presets), [DatePickerInput](https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/components/datepicker#presets) and [DateTimePicker](https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/components/datetimepicker#presets) \nnow support `presets` prop that allows you to add custom date presets. Presets are displayed next to the calendar:\n\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date, timedelta\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ntoday = date.today()\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    dmc.DatePicker(\n        presets=[\n            {\n                \"value\": (today - timedelta(days=1)).isoformat(),\n                \"label\": \"Yesterday\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": today.isoformat(),\n                \"label\": \"Today\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": (today + timedelta(days=1)).isoformat(),\n                \"label\": \"Tomorrow\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": (today + relativedelta(months=1)).isoformat(),\n                \"label\": \"Next month\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": (today + relativedelta(years=1)).isoformat(),\n                \"label\": \"Next year\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": (today - relativedelta(months=1)).isoformat(),\n                \"label\": \"Last month\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"value\": (today - relativedelta(years=1)).isoformat(),\n                \"label\": \"Last year\",\n            },\n        ]\n    )\n)\n```\n### Other notable updates\n\n* Mantine patch updates from 8.3.10 through 8.3.13. See the [Mantine Releases](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/releases) for details.\n\n- AppShell: Add static `mode` support for nested app shells\n- Added `selectFirstOptionOnDropdownOpen` and `openOnFocus`props to Combobox based components.\n- Fixed `PinInput` so that `value` can be set initially and in a callback\n\n### Thanks\n\nSpecial thanks to:\n\n* [@EstanVW25](https://github.com/EstanVW25) first time contributor for adding the Datpeick presets docs. \n* [@deadkex](https://github.com/deadkex) for your dedication to getting the TableofContent PR over the finishline!   \n* [@BSd3v](https://github.com/BSd3v) for PR #653 to make it possible to make custom DMC components.\n* [@alexcjohnson](https://github.com/alexcjohnson) for your thoughtful feedback during code reviews."

Note that if `theme.headings.fontFamily` is not set,\n`--mantine-font-family-headings` value will be the same as `--mantine-font-family`\n\n\n```python\ntheme = {\n    # Controls --mantine-font-family\n    \"fontFamily\": \"Arial, sans-serif\",\n\n    # Controls --mantine-font-family-monospace\n    \"fontFamilyMonospace\": \"Courier New, monospace\",\n\n    \"headings\": {\n        # Controls --mantine-font-family-headings\n        \"fontFamily\": \"Georgia, serif\",\n    },\n}\ndmc.MantineProvider(theme=theme, children=[])\n```\n\nIf you want to use system fonts as a fallback for custom fonts, you can reference `dmc.DEFAULT_THEME` value instead of defining it manually:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ntheme = {\n    \"fontFamily\": f\"Roboto, {dmc.DEFAULT_THEME['fontFamily']}\"\n}\n```\nYou can reference font family variables in your CSS:\n\n```css\n\n.text {\n  font-family: var(--mantine-font-family);\n}\n\n.code {\n  font-family: var(--mantine-font-family-monospace);\n}\n\n.heading {\n  font-family: var(--mantine-font-family-headings);\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd in `ff` style prop:\n\n- `ff=\"text\"` will use `--mantine-font-family` variable\n- `ff=\"monospace\"` will use `--mantine-font-family-monospace` variable\n- `ff=\"heading\"` will use `--mantine-font-family-headings` variable\n\n\n```python\ndmc.Text(\n    \"This text uses --mantine-font-family-monospace variable\",\n    ff=\"monospace\"\n)\n```\n\n\n#### Font size\n\nFont size variables are used in most Mantine components to control text size. The variable that is chosen depends on\nthe component and its size prop.\n\n| Variable                        | Default value   |\n|:--------------------------------|:----------------|\n| --mantine-font-size-xs          | 0.75rem (12px)  |\n| --mantine-font-size-sm          | 0.875rem (14px) |\n| --mantine-font-size-md          | 1rem (16px)     |\n| --mantine-font-size-lg          | 1.125rem (18px) |\n| --mantine-font-size-xl          | 1.25rem (20px)  |\n\nYou can reference font size variables in CSS:\n\n```css\n.demo {\n  font-size: var(--mantine-font-size-md);\n}\n```\n\nAnd in `fz` style prop:\n```python\ndmc.Text(\n    \"This text uses --mantine-font-size-xl variable\",\n    fz=\"xl\"\n)\n```\n\nTo define custom font sizes, can use `theme.fontSizes` property:\n\n```python\ntheme = {\n    'fontSizes': {\n    'xs': '0.5rem',\n    'sm': '0.75rem',\n    'md': '1rem',\n    'lg': '1.25rem',\n    'xl': '1.5rem',\n  },\n}\ndmc.MantineProvider(theme=theme, children=[])\n```\n\n\nNote that `theme.fontSizes` dict is merged with the dmc.DEFAULT_THEME – it is not required to define all values, only those that you want to change.\n\n```python\ntheme = {\n    'fontSizes': {'xs': '0.5rem'}\n}\n```\n\nYou can add any number of additional font sizes to the `theme.fontSizes` object. These values will be defined as\nCSS variables in `--mantine-font-size-{size}` format:\n\n\n```python\ntheme = {\n    'fontSizes': {\n        'xxs': '0.125rem',\n        'xxl': '2rem',\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAfter defining `theme.fontSizes`, you can reference these variables in your CSS:\n\n```css\n.demo {\n  font-size: var(--mantine-font-size-xxs);\n}\n```\n\n> Case conversion\n>\n>Case conversion (camelCase to kebab-case) is not automatically applied to custom font sizes. If you define `theme.fontSizes`\nwith camelCase keys, you need to reference them in camelCase format. For example, if you define `{ customSize: '1rem' }`, you need to reference it as `--mantine-font-size-customSize`.\n\n\n#### Line height\n\nLine height variables are used in the Text component. In other components, line-height is either calculated based on font size or set to `--mantine-line-height`, which is an alias for `--mantine-line-height-md`.\n\n| Variable                      | Default value  |\n|:------------------------------|:---------------|\n| --mantine-line-height         | 1.55           |\n| --mantine-line-height-xs      | 1.4            |\n| --mantine-line-height-sm      | 1.45           |\n| --mantine-line-height-md      | 1.55           |\n| --mantine-line-height-lg      | 1.6            |\n| --mantine-line-height-xl      | 1.65           |\n\nYou can reference line height variables in your CSS:\n\n```css\n.demo {\n  line-height: var(--mantine-line-height-md);\n}\n```\n\n```python\ndmc.Text(\"This text uses --mantine-line-height-xl variable\", lh=\"xl\")\n```\n\nTo define custom line heights, you can use theme.lineHeights property:\n\n```python\ntheme = {\n    'lineHeights': {\n    'xs': '1.2',\n    'sm': '1.3',\n    'md': '1.4',\n    'lg': '1.5',\n    'xl': '1.6',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Headings\n\n`theme.headings` controls `font-size`, `line-height`, `font-weight`, and `text-wrap` CSS properties of headings in `Title` and `TypographyStylesProvider` components.\n\n| Variable                        | Default value   |\n|:--------------------------------|:----------------|\n| **General variables**           |                 |\n| --mantine-heading-font-weight   | 700             |\n| --mantine-heading-text-wrap     | wrap            |\n| **h1 heading**                  |                 |\n| --mantine-h1-font-size          | 2.125rem (34px) |\n| --mantine-h1-line-height        | 1.3             |\n| --mantine-h1-font-weight        | 700             |\n| **h2 heading**                  |                 |\n| --mantine-h2-font-size          | 1.625rem (26px) |\n| --mantine-h2-line-height        | 1.35            |\n| --mantine-h2-font-weight        | 700             |\n| **h3 heading**                  |                 |\n| --mantine-h3-font-size          | 1.375rem (22px) |\n| --mantine-h3-line-height        | 1.4             |\n| --mantine-h3-font-weight        | 700             |\n| **h4 heading**                  |                 |\n| --mantine-h4-font-size          | 1.125rem (18px) |\n| --mantine-h4-line-height        | 1.45            |\n| --mantine-h4-font-weight        | 700             |\n| **h5 heading**                  |                 |\n| --mantine-h5-font-size          | 1rem (16px)     |\n| --mantine-h5-line-height        | 1.5             |\n| --mantine-h5-font-weight        | 700             |\n| **h6 heading**                  |                 |\n| --mantine-h6-font-size          | 0.875rem (14px) |\n| --mantine-h6-line-height        | 1.5             |\n| --mantine-h6-font-weight        | 700             |\n\nThese variables are used in the `Title` component. The `order` prop controls which heading level to use. For example, `order={3}` Title will use:\n\n- `--mantine-h3-font-size`\n- `--mantine-h3-line-height`\n- `--mantine-h3-font-weight`\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        dmc.Title(f\"This is h1 title\", order=1),\n        dmc.Title(f\"This is h2 title\", order=2),\n        dmc.Title(f\"This is h3 title\", order=3),\n        dmc.Title(f\"This is h4 title\", order=4),\n        dmc.Title(f\"This is h5 title\", order=5),\n        dmc.Title(f\"This is h6 title\", order=6),\n    ]\n)\n```\nYou can reference heading variables in your CSS:\n\n\n```css\n.h1 {\n  font-size: var(--mantine-h1-font-size);\n  line-height: var(--mantine-h1-line-height);\n  font-weight: var(--mantine-h1-font-weight);\n}\n```\nAnd in fz and lh style props:\n\n```python\ndmc.Text(\"This text uses --mantine-h1-* variables\",  fz=\"h1\", lh=\"h1\")\n```\n\nTo change heading styles, can use `theme.headings` property:\n\n```python\ntheme = {\n    \"headings\": {\n        \"sizes\": {\n            \"h1\": {\n                \"fontSize\": \"2rem\",\n                \"lineHeight\": \"1.5\",\n                \"fontWeight\": \"500\",\n            },\n            \"h2\": {\n                \"fontSize\": \"1.5rem\",\n                \"lineHeight\": \"1.6\",\n                \"fontWeight\": \"500\",\n            },\n        },\n        # ...\n    },\n}\n```\n\n`theme.headings` dict is deeply merged with the default theme – it is not required to define all values, only those that you want to change.\n\n\n```python\ntheme = {\n    \"headings\": {\n        \"sizes\": {\n            \"h1\": {\n                \"fontSize\": \"2rem\",             \n            },          \n        },    \n    },\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Font smoothing\n\nFont smoothing variables control `-webkit-font-smoothing` and `moz-osx-font-smoothing` CSS properties. These variables are used to make text look better on screens with high pixel density.\n\nFont smoothing variables are controlled by the `theme.fontSmoothing` theme property, which is `True` by default. If `theme.fontSmoothing` is `False`, both variables will be set to `unset`.\n\n| Variable                        | Default value  |\n|:--------------------------------|:---------------|\n| --mantine-webkit-font-smoothing | antialiased    |\n| --mantine-moz-font-smoothing    | grayscale      |\n\nIf you need to override font smoothing values, the best way is to disable `theme.fontSmoothing` and set global styles on the `body` element:\n\n```python\n# Disable font smoothing in your theme\ntheme = {\n  \"fontSmoothing\": False,\n}\n```\n\nAdd global styles to your project with desired font smoothing values\n```css\nbody {\n  -webkit-font-smoothing: subpixel-antialiased;\n  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: auto;\n}\n```\n\n\n### Colors variables\n\nColors variables are controlled by `theme.colors` and `theme.primaryColor`. Each color defined in the `theme.colors` object is required to have 10 shades. Theme colors can be referenced by their name and shade index, for example, `--mantine-color-red-6`.\n\nYou can define new colors on the theme object or override existing colors:\n\n```python\ntheme = {\n    \"colors\": {\n        \"demo\": [\n            \"#FF0000\",\n            \"#FF3333\",\n            \"#FF6666\",\n            \"#FF9999\",\n            \"#FFCCCC\",\n            \"#FFEEEE\",\n            \"#FFFAFA\",\n            \"#FFF5F5\",\n            \"#FFF0F0\",\n            \"#FFEBEB\",\n        ],\n    },\n}\n```\n\nThe code above will define the following CSS variables:\n\n| Variable                      | Default value  |\n|:------------------------------|:---------------|\n| --mantine-color-demo-0        | #FF0000        |\n| --mantine-color-demo-1        | #FF3333        |\n| --mantine-color-demo-2        | #FF6666        |\n| --mantine-color-demo-3        | #FF9999        |\n| --mantine-color-demo-4        | #FFCCCC        |\n| --mantine-color-demo-5        | #FFEEEE        |\n| --mantine-color-demo-6        | #FFFAFA        |\n| --mantine-color-demo-7        | #FFF5F5        |\n| --mantine-color-demo-8        | #FFF0F0        |\n| --mantine-color-demo-9        | #FFEBEB        |\n\n#### Variant colors\n\nSome Mantine components like `Button` or `Badge` have the `variant` prop that in combination with the `color` prop controls the component text, background, and border colors. For each variant and color, Mantine defines a set of CSS variables that control these colors. For example, for the default blue color the following CSS variables are defined:\n\n| Variable                                         | Default value                 |\n|:-------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------|\n| **Filled variant**                               |                               |\n| --mantine-color-blue-filled                      | var(--mantine-color-blue-6)   |\n| --mantine-color-blue-filled-hover                | var(--mantine-color-blue-7)   |\n| **Light variant**                                |                               |\n| --mantine-color-blue-light                       | rgba(34, 139, 230, 0.1)       |\n| --mantine-color-blue-light-hover                 | rgba(34, 139, 230, 0.12)      |\n| --mantine-color-blue-light-color                 | var(--mantine-color-blue-6)   |\n| **Outline variant**                              |                               |\n| --mantine-color-blue-outline                     | var(--mantine-color-blue-6)   |\n| --mantine-color-blue-outline-hover               | rgba(34, 139, 230, 0.05)      |\n\n\nFor example, if you use Button component the following way:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Button(\"Pink filled button\", color=\"pink\", variant=\"filled\")\n```\nThe component will have the following styles:\n\n- Background color will be `var(--mantine-color-pink-filled)`\n- Background color on hover will be `var(--mantine-color-pink-filled-hover)`\n- Text color will be `var(--mantine-color-white)`\n- Border color will be `transparent`\n\nNote that the variables above are not static; they are generated based on the values of `theme.colors` and `theme.primaryShade`. Additionally, their values are different for dark and light color schemes.\n\n#### Variant Colors Variables\n\nVariant colors variables are used in all components that support the `color` prop, for example, `Button`, `Badge`, `Avatar`, and `Pagination`. The color values used by these components are determined by `cssVariablesResolver` and `variantColorResolver`.\n\n#### Primary Color Variables\n\nPrimary color variables are defined by `theme.primaryColor` (which must be a key of `theme.colors`). The following CSS variables are defined for the primary color:\n\n| Variable                                      | Default value                                      |\n|:----------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|\n| --mantine-primary-color-{shade}               | `var(--mantine-color-{primaryColor}-{shade})`      |\n| --mantine-primary-color-filled                | `var(--mantine-color-{primaryColor}-filled)`       |\n| --mantine-primary-color-filled-hover          | `var(--mantine-color-{primaryColor}-filled-hover)` |\n| --mantine-primary-color-light                 | `var(--mantine-color-{primaryColor}-light)`        |\n| --mantine-primary-color-light-hover           | `var(--mantine-color-{primaryColor}-light-hover)`  |\n| --mantine-primary-color-light-color           | `var(--mantine-color-{primaryColor}-light-color)`  |\n\nYou can reference primary color variables in CSS:\n\n```css\n.demo {\n  color: var(--mantine-primary-color-0);\n  background-color: var(--mantine-primary-color-filled);\n}\n```\n\n#### Other Color Variables\n\nThe following colors are used in various Mantine components.

The following CSS variables are defined based on `theme.spacing`:\n\n| Variable               | Default value   |\n|------------------------|-----------------|\n| --mantine-spacing-xs   | 0.625rem (10px) |\n| --mantine-spacing-sm   | 0.75rem (12px)  |\n| --mantine-spacing-md   | 1rem (16px)     |\n| --mantine-spacing-lg   | 1.25rem (20px)  |\n| --mantine-spacing-xl   | 2rem (32px)     |\n\nTo define custom spacing values, use the `theme.spacing` property:\n\n```python\ntheme = {\n    \"spacing\": {\n        \"xs\": \"0.5rem\",\n        \"sm\": \"0.75rem\",\n        \"md\": \"1rem\",\n        \"lg\": \"1.5rem\",\n        \"xl\": \"2rem\",\n    },\n}\n```\n\n### Border radius variables\n\nMantine components that support the `radius` prop use border radius variables to control border radius. The following CSS variables are defined based on `theme.radius`:\n\n| Variable                 | Default value  |\n|--------------------------|----------------|\n| --mantine-radius-xs      | 0.125rem (2px) |\n| --mantine-radius-sm      | 0.25rem (4px)  |\n| --mantine-radius-md      | 0.5rem (8px)   |\n| --mantine-radius-lg      | 1rem (16px)    |\n| --mantine-radius-xl      | 2rem (32px)    |\n\nAdditionally, `--mantine-radius-default` variable is defined based on `theme.defaultRadius` value. If the `radius` prop on components is not set explicitly, `--mantine-radius-default` is used instead.\n\nTo define custom border radius values, use the `theme.radius` and `theme.defaultRadius` properties:\n\n```python\ntheme = {\n    \"defaultRadius\": \"sm\",\n    \"radius\": {\n        \"xs\": \"0.25rem\",\n        \"sm\": \"0.5rem\",\n        \"md\": \"1rem\",\n        \"lg\": \"2rem\",\n        \"xl\": \"3rem\",\n    },\n}\n```\n\n\n### Shadow variables\n\nShadow variables are used in all Mantine components that support the `shadow` prop. The following CSS variables are defined based on `theme.shadows`:\n\n| Variable              | Default value                                                                                          |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| --mantine-shadow-xs   | 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)                                            |\n| --mantine-shadow-sm   | 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05) 0 10px 15px -5px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04) 0 7px 7px -5px |\n| --mantine-shadow-md   | 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05) 0 20px 25px -5px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04) 0 10px 10px -5px|\n| --mantine-shadow-lg   | 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05) 0 28px 23px -7px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04) 0 12px 12px -7px|\n| --mantine-shadow-xl   | 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05) 0 36px 28px -7px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04) 0 17px 17px -7px|\n\nTo define custom shadow values, use the `theme.shadows` property:\n\n```python\ntheme = {\n    \"shadows\": {\n        \"xs\": \"0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)\",\n        \"sm\": \"0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)\",\n        \"md\": \"0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)\",\n        \"lg\": \"0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)\",\n        \"xl\": \"0 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)\",\n    },\n}\n```\n\n### z-index variables\n\nz-index variables are defined in `@mantine/core/styles.css`. Unlike other variables, z-index variables are not controlled by the theme and are not exposed in the theme object.\n\n| Variable                  | Default value |\n|---------------------------|---------------|\n| --mantine-z-index-app     | 100           |\n| --mantine-z-index-modal   | 200           |\n| --mantine-z-index-popover | 300           |\n| --mantine-z-index-overlay | 400           |\n| --mantine-z-index-max     | 9999          |\n\nYou can reference z-index variables in CSS:\n\n```css\n/* Display content above the modal */\n.my-content {\n  z-index: calc(var(--mantine-z-index-modal) + 1);\n}\n```\n\nAnd in components by referencing the CSS variable:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Modal(\n    zIndex=\"var(--mantine-z-index-max)\",\n    opened=True,\n    children=\"Modal content\"\n) \n```\n\n### CSS Variables list\n\n#### CSS variables not depending on color scheme\n#### Light color scheme

Check out the [Layout Overview](/layout-overview) section\nfor tips on selecting the right layout components.  \n\n### Media Queries\n\nResize the browser window to see the color changing between blue and red.\n\n```python\nfrom dash import html\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\"Demo\", className=\"media-query-demo\")\n```\n```css\n\n.media-query-demo  {\n  background-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-filled);\n  color: var(--mantine-color-white);\n  padding: var(--mantine-spacing-md);\n  text-align: center;\n\n  @media (min-width: 48em) {\n    background-color: var(--mantine-color-red-filled);\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nWhen choosing between pixels (px) and rems (rem or em) for media queries, it's generally recommended to use rems because they\nare relative to the user's font size, making your design more accessible and responsive to different browser zoom\nlevels; whereas pixels are absolute and won't adjust with font size changes.\n\nNote that the rem unit is relative to the document's root element, while the em unit is relative to the immediate \nparent of the targeted element. In Mantine, breakpoints are expected to be set in em units to align with its contextual\nscaling approach.\n\n### Configure breakpoints\n`theme.breakpoints` are used in all responsive Mantine components. Breakpoints are expected to be set in `em` units. You\ncan configure these values in the [Theme Object](/theme-object) in the `MantineProvider`:\n\nYou can customize the `breakpoints` defaults in the `theme`: \n\n```python\ntheme = {\n    \"breakpoints\": {\n        \"xs\": '30em',              # customize breakpoints here\n        \"sm\": '48em',\n        \"md\": '64em',\n        \"lg\": '74em',\n        \"xl\": '90em',\n  },\n}\n\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    # your layout,\n    theme=theme\n)\n```\n\n### Default `theme.breakpoints` Values\n\n| Breakpoint | Viewport width | Value in px |\n|------------|----------------|-------------|\n| xs         | 36em           | 576px       |\n| sm         | 48em           | 768px       |\n| md         | 62em           | 992px       |\n| lg         | 75em           | 1200px      |\n| xl         | 88em           | 1408px      |\n\n\n\n### hiddenFrom and visibleFrom props\nAll Mantine components that have a root element support `hiddenFrom` and `visibleFrom` props. These props accept breakpoint\n(`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`) and hide the component when viewport width is less than or greater than the specified breakpoint:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    justify=\"center\",\n    children=[\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Hidden from sm\",\n            hiddenFrom=\"sm\",\n            color=\"orange\"\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Visible from sm\",\n            visibleFrom=\"sm\",\n            color=\"cyan\"\n        ),\n        dmc.Button(\n            \"Visible from md\",\n            visibleFrom=\"md\",\n            color=\"pink\"\n        )\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Hidden and visible from as classes\nIf you are building a component and want to use the same logic as in `hiddenFrom` and `visibleFrom` props but you do\nnot want to use Mantine components, you can use` mantine-hidden-from-{x}` and `mantine-visible-from-{x}` classes.\n\n```python\nhtml.Div(\"Hidden from md\", className=\"mantine-hidden-from-md\")\nhtml.Div(\"visible from xl\", className=\"mantine-visible-from-xl\")\n\n```\n\n### Component size based on media query\nSome components support `size` prop, which changes various aspects of component appearance. `size` prop is not\nresponsive – it is not possible to define different component sizes for different screen sizes. \n\n### Container queries\nContainer queries enable you to apply styles to an element based on the size of the element's container. If, for\nexample, a container has less space available in the surrounding context, you can hide certain elements or use \nsmaller fonts. Container queries are supported in all modern browsers.\n\nNote that CSS variables do not work in container queries and because of that rem scaling feature is not available. \nIf you rely on this feature, it is better to define breakpoints in px units.\n\n\n```python\nfrom dash import html\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    className=\"container-query-demo-root\",\n    children=html.Div(\n        \"Resize parent element to see container query in action\",\n        className=\"container-query-demo-child\"\n    )\n)\n```\nAdd the following to a .css file in /assets\n\n```css\n\n.container-query-demo-root {\n  min-width: 200px;\n  max-width: 100%;\n  min-height: 120px;\n  container-type: inline-size;\n  overflow: auto;\n  resize: horizontal;\n  border: solid;\n  border-color: var(--mantine-color-default-border)\n}\n\n.container-query-demo-child {\n  background-color: var(--mantine-color-dimmed);\n  color: var(--mantine-color-white);\n  padding: var(--mantine-spacing-md);\n\n  @container (max-width: 500px) {\n    background-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-filled);\n  }\n\n  @container (max-width: 300px) {\n    background-color: var(--mantine-color-red-filled);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Responsive styles\n\nYou can pass a dictionary to style props to add responsive styles with [style props](/style-props). \nNote that responsive style props are less performant than regular style props, it is not recommended using them in large amounts.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box(\n    \"Box with responsive style props\",\n    w={\"base\": 200, \"sm\": 400, \"lg\": 500},\n    py={\"base\": \"xs\", \"sm\": \"md\", \"lg\": \"xl\"},\n    bg={\"base\": \"blue.7\", \"sm\": \"red.7\", \"lg\": \"green.7\"},\n    c=\"#fff\",\n    ta=\"center\",\n    mx=\"auto\",\n)\n```\nResponsive values are calculated the following way:\n\n- `base` value is used when none of the breakpoint values are provided\n- `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl` values are used when the viewport width is larger that the value of corresponding breakpoint specified in `dmc.DEFAULT_THEME`.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.Box(w={ \"base\": 320, \"sm\": 480, \"lg\": 640 })\n```\n\nIn this case the element will have the following styles:\n\n```css\n/* Base styles added to element and then get overwritten with responsive values */\n.element {\n  width: 20rem;\n}\n\n/* 48em is theme.breakpoints.sm by default */\n@media (min-width: 48em) {\n  .element {\n    width: 30rem;\n  }\n}\n\n/* 75em is theme.breakpoints.lg by default */\n@media (min-width: 75em) {\n  .element {\n    width: 40rem;\n  }\n}\n```"

    "content": "\n\n## Styles API  \nWith Styles API you can overwrite styles of inner elements in Mantine components with classNames or styles props.  \nCategory: Styling  \n\n### Styles API Overview\n\nDMC supports `style` and `className` props for styling the root element, just like other Dash libraries.\nHowever, many DMC components have nested elements.  For example the `TextInput` includes `label`, `description`,\n`error` props.\n\nThe Styles API is a set of props and techniques that allows you to customize the style of any element inside a Mantine\ncomponent - inline using the  `classNames` or `styles` props, or using the [Theme Object](/theme-object).\n\n\n### Styles API Selectors\n\nEach component has its own set of selectors based on its structure. These are documented in the Styles API section of each component’s page.\n\n\n#### Example: `dmc.Button` Selectors\n\n| Name    | Static selector         | Description                      |\n| :------ | :---------------------- | :------------------------------- |\n| root    | .mantine-Button-root    | Root element                     |\n| loader  | .mantine-Button-loader  | Loader shown when `loading=True` |\n| section | .mantine-Button-section | Left and right icon sections     |\n| inner   | .mantine-Button-inner   | Container for label and content  |\n| label   | .mantine-Button-label   | The button’s text                |\n\n\nYou can use these selectors in multiple ways:\n\n#### 1) With `classNames` or `styles` props\n\n```python\n# Using classNames\ndmc.Button(\n    \"Styled with classNames\",\n    classNames={\n        \"root\": \"my-root-class\",\n        \"label\": \"my-label-class\",\n        \"inner\": \"my-inner-class\",\n    }\n)\n\n# Using inline styles\ndmc.Button(\n    \"Styled with styles prop\",\n    styles={\n        \"root\": {\"backgroundColor\": \"red\"},\n        \"label\": {\"color\": \"blue\"},\n        \"inner\": {\"fontSize\": 20},\n    }\n)\n```\n\n#### 2) In the `theme` prop in  `MantineProvider`\n\n```python\ntheme = {\n    \"components\": {\n        \"Button\": {\n            \"classNames\": {\n                \"root\": \"my-root-class\",\n                \"label\": \"my-label-class\",\n                \"inner\": \"my-inner-class\",\n            },\n            \"styles\": {\n                \"root\": {\"backgroundColor\": \"red\"},\n                \"label\": {\"color\": \"blue\"},\n                \"inner\": {\"fontSize\": 20},\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    theme=theme,\n    children=dmc.Button(\"Themed Button\")\n)\n```\n\n#### 3) In a `.css` file using static selectors\n\n```css\n.mantine-Button-root {\n    background-color: red;\n}\n\n.mantine-Button-label {\n    color: blue;\n}\n\n.mantine-Button-inner {\n    font-size: 20px;\n}\n```\n\n### classNames Prop\n\nThe `classNames` prop is used to apply custom CSS class names to specific inner elements of a Mantine component. It \naccepts a dictionary  with element names as keys and classes as values. This approach is preferred for larger-scale styling and\nmaintainability.\n\n\n### Styles Prop\n\nThe `styles` prop is used to apply inline styles directly to specific inner elements of a Mantine component. It accepts\nan dictionary where keys correspond to the names of the inner elements (as defined in the component's Styles API documentation)\nand values are style objects. Inline styles have higher specificity than classes, meaning they will override styles\ndefined by classes unless `!important` is explicitly used in the class definition.\n\nYou cannot use pseudo-classes (for example, `:hover`, `:first-of-type`) and media queries inside the `styles` prop.\n\n\n> styles prop usage\n>\n> Some examples and demos in the documentation use the `styles` prop for convenience, but it is not recommended to use the `styles` prop as the primary means of styling components, as the `classNames` prop is more flexible and has better performance.\n\n### Avoid dynamic class names\n\nWhen inspecting elements in the browser, you may see generated class names like `m_77c9d27d`. These are internal to Mantine and can change between versions. Don’t target these in your CSS.\n\nInstead, use:\n\n* the `styles` or `classNames` props\n* static class selectors like `.mantine-Button-root`\n\n\n\n### Global vs. Specific Styling\n\nYou can combine global styling (via `theme` or static CSS) with component-specific overrides using `styles` or `classNames`.\n\nFor example:\n\n* A default red background can be applied globally using `.mantine-Button-root`\n* A specific button can override this with its own `className` or `styles`\n\nNote: For components rendered in a portal — such as `Popover`, `Tooltip`, or `Modal` — static selectors often won’t work because parts of the DOM are rendered outside the main tree. In these cases, use `classNames` or `styles`, or set `withinPortal=False` if appropriate.\n\n\n### Component Classes\n\nMantine uses hashed class names (e.g., `m_77c9d27d`) for internal styling. These class names may change between versions or builds, so you should never rely on them directly.\n\n**Do not do this:**\n\n```css\n/* This is fragile and will likely break */\n.m_77c9d27d {\n  background: blue;\n}\n```\n\n**Instead, do this:**\n\n```css\n/* Use static selectors */\n.mantine-Button-root {\n  background: blue;\n}\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```python\n# Use the Styles API\ndmc.Button(\n    \"Styled Button\",\n    classNames={\"root\": \"my-custom-button\"}\n)\n```\n\n\n\n### Data Attributes\n\nMany Mantine components use `data-*` attributes to reflect state or props. These can be useful for styling in CSS, especially when using features like loading states, icons, or layout modifiers.\n\nYou’ll find a list of data attributes for each component in its Styles API docs.\n\nExample (`dmc.Button`):\n\n| Selector  | Attribute                | Set When…            | Example value     |\n| --------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------- |\n| `root`    | `data-disabled`          | `disabled=True`      | –                 |\n| `root`    | `data-loading`           | `loading=True`       | –                 |\n| `root`    | `data-block`             | `fullWidth=True`     | –                 |\n| `root`    | `data-with-left-section` | `leftSection` is set | –                 |\n| `section` | `data-position`          | Always               | `left` or `right` |\n\nExample CSS targeting data attributes:\n\n```css\n/* Style disabled buttons */\n.dmc-data-attributes-demo[data-disabled=\"true\"] {\n    color: red;\n    cursor: not-allowed;\n}\n\n/* Style buttons while loading */\n.dmc-data-attributes-demo[data-loading=\"true\"] {\n    background-color: darkgray;\n}\n\n/* Style left icon section */\n.dmc-data-attributes-demo .mantine-Button-section[data-position=\"left\"] {\n    color: var(--mantine-color-yellow-filled);\n}\n```\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group(\n    [\n        dmc.Button(\"Default Button\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Disabled Button\", disabled=True, className=\"dmc-data-attributes-demo\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Loading Button\", loading=True, className=\"dmc-data-attributes-demo\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Button with Left Section\", leftSection=html.Div(\"left\"), className=\"dmc-data-attributes-demo\"),\n    ],\n    gap=\"sm\"\n)\n```\n### attributes prop\n\nUse `attributes` prop to pass attributes to inner elements of all components that support Styles API. For example,\nit can be used to add data attributes for testing purposes:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.Button(\n    \"Button with attributes\",\n    attributes={\n        \"root\": { \"data-test-id\": \"root\" },\n        \"label\": { \"data-test-id\": \"label\" },\n        \"inner\": { \"data-test-id\": \"inner\" },\n      },\n)\n```\n### More Examples\n\nHere are a few component-specific examples. Refer to each component’s Styles API section for the full list of selectors and attributes.\n\n#### Button\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\n\ncomponent = dmc.Button(\n    \"Settings\",\n    leftSection=DashIconify(icon=\"ic:baseline-settings-input-composite\"),\n    styles={\"root\": {\"fontWeight\": 400}, \"section\": {\"width\": 100}},\n)\n```\n#### Badge\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Badge(\n    \"Badge 1\",\n    variant=\"dot\",\n    styles={\n        \"root\": {\"borderWidth\": 1, \"height\": 30, \"padding\": 10},\n        \"inner\": {\"fontWeight\": 500},\n    },\n)\n```\n#### TextInput\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.TextInput(\n    label=\"TextInput with custom styles\",\n    placeholder=\"TextInput with custom styles\",\n    description=\"Description below the input\",\n    w=300,\n    styles={\n        \"input\": {\"borderColor\":  \"var(--mantine-color-violet-4)\"},\n        \"label\": {\n            \"color\": \"blue\",\n            \"backgroundColor\":  \"var(--mantine-color-yellow-1)\",\n        },\n    },\n)\n```\n### Styles with Callbacks\n\n```python\nfrom dash import  html, callback, Output, Input, State\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = html.Div([\n    dmc.TextInput(\n        id=\"styles-input\",\n        label=\"Required Input\",\n        required=True,\n    ),\n    dmc.Button(\"Submit\", id=\"styles-submit-btn\")\n])\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"styles-input\", \"styles\"),\n    Input(\"styles-submit-btn\", \"n_clicks\"),\n    State(\"styles-input\", \"value\"),\n    prevent_initial_call=True\n)\ndef update_styles(n_clicks, value):\n    if not value:\n        return {\n            \"input\": {\"borderColor\": \"red\"},\n            \"label\": {\"color\": \"red\"}\n        }\n    return {\n        \"input\": {\"borderColor\": \"green\"},\n        \"label\": {\"color\": \"green\"}\n    }\n```\n### Slider\n\nSee the [Styling the Slider](/components/slider#styling-the-slider) section for a detailed example including:\n\n* Dynamic theming with `light-dark`\n* Custom styling for tracks, marks, and thumbs\n* Attribute-based styling using `[data-filled]`\n\n\n### Tabs\n\nFor another advanced example, see the [Styling the Tabs](/components/tabs#styling-the-tabs) section.\n\n\n### DatePickerInput\n\nComponents that use portals (like `Popover`, `Modal`, and `Tooltip`) often render outside the DOM tree. To style their internal parts:\n\n* Use `classNames` or `styles` props\n* Or set `withinPortal=False` if supported\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.DatePickerInput(\n        label=\"Default Calendar style\"\n    ),\n    dmc.DatePickerInput(\n        label=\"Calendar without red weekend days\",\n        styles={\"day\": {\"color\": \"var(--mantine-color-text)\"}},\n    )\n])\n```"

For example, `Button` component has\n`color`, `variant`, `size` and `radius` props that control its appearance:\n\n\n### Style props\n\n[Style props](/style-props) work similar to component specific props, but with several differences:\n\n- Style props are not component specific, they can be used with any component.\n- Style props always control a single CSS property. For example, `c` prop controls CSS `color` property, while `color` prop controls a set of properties: `color`, `background-color` and `border-color`.\n- Style props are set in style attribute. It is not possible to override them with CSS without using `!important`.\n\n[Style props](/style-props) are useful when you need to change a single CSS property without creating a separate file for styles. Some of the most common use cases are:\n\n\n- Changing text color and font-size\n\n```python\n\ndmc.Card([\n    dmc.Text(\"Card title\", c=\"blue.8\", fz=\"lg\"),\n    dmc.Text(\"Card description\", c=\"dimmed\", fz=\"sm\")\n])\n```\n\n- Applying margins to inputs inside a form:\n\n```python\ndmc.Paper([\n    dmc.TextInput(label=\"First name\"),\n    dmc.TextInput(label=\"Last name\", mt=\"md\"),\n    dmc.TextInput(label=\"Email\", mt=\"md\")    \n])\n```\n\n- Adding padding to various elements:\n\n```python\ndmc.Paper(\"My custom card\", p=\"xl\")\n```\n\nNote that style props were never intended to be used as a primary way of styling components. In most cases, it is better\nto limit the number of style props used per component to 3-4. If you find yourself using more than 4 style props, \nconsider creating a separate CSS file with styles – it will be easier to maintain and will be more performant.\n\n\n### style prop\n\nYou can use the `style` prop to define inline styles, just like in other dash components:\n```python\ndmc.Card(style={\"backgroundColor\": \"blue\", \"color\": \"white\"})\n```\n\n### className prop\nYou can define CSS classes in a `.css` file in the `/assets` folder. These can then be referenced using the `className` prop, just like in other dash components:\n\n```python \ndmc.Card(className=\"card-style\")\n```\n\n.css file:\n```css\n.card-style {\n    background-color: blue;\n    color: white;\n}\n```\n\n### Styles API\n\nNote that the `style` and the `className` props will apply style to the root of the component.  Many DMC components contain\nmultiple elements, for example the `TextInput` includes `label`, `description`, `error` props.  \n\nUse the `classNames` or `styles` props to target the nested elements.  See more information in the [StylesAPI](/styles-api) section.\n\n- `styles` prop: Used to apply inline styles directly to specific inner elements of a Mantine component.\n- `classNames`prop: Used to apply custom CSS class names to specific inner elements of a Mantine component\n\n### theme prop in MantineProvider\n\nDMC includes a great default theme that supports light and dark mode. Use the `theme` prop to change the global styles.\n\nFor those of you familiar with Dash Bootstrap Components, this is similar to setting the theme using a Bootstrap\nstylesheet. However, in DMC, instead of linking to a  CSS file, you can directly define the theme using a Python\ndictionary, which makes it easy to customize the theme. For example, you can  override colors, fonts, spacing,\nand even component-specific styles globally.\n\nFor more information see the [Theme Object](/theme-object) section.\n\n\n###  Theme Tokens\n\nA theme token is a named value from the global theme, like a color, spacing unit, or font family. In DMC, these tokens\ncan be used in any styles with the Mantine [CSS variables](/css-variables):\n\nFor example:\n\n - In a `.css` file in `/assets`:\n\n```css\n.root {\n  background: var(--mantine-color-red-5); /* red[5] from theme.colors */\n  margin-top: var(--mantine-spacing-md);  /* md from theme.spacing */\n}\n```\n\n-  In style props:\n```python\ndcc.Box(bg=\"red.5\", mt=\"xl\")\n# Shorthand for: var(--mantine-color-red-5), var(--mantine-spacing-xl)\n```\n\n- In the `style` prop:\n```python\ndcc.Box(style={\"backgroundColor\": \"var(--mantine-color-red-5)\"})\n\n```"

Each color has 10 shades.\n\n\n### Colors in the default theme\n\nColors are stored in the [theme object](/theme-object) as an array of strings. Each color is indexed from `0` (lightest) to `9`\n(darkest). The default theme is available as `dmc.DEFAULT_THEME`, which contains all theme properties with their default values.\n\nFor example, access a specific shade by using the color name and index: `dmc.DEFAULT_THEME['colors']['blue'][1]`\nColors with larger indices are darker.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    \" This is a blue element\",\n    style={\n        \"backgroundColor\": dmc.DEFAULT_THEME[\"colors\"][\"blue\"][1],\n        \"color\": dmc.DEFAULT_THEME[\"colors\"][\"blue\"][9],\n        \"padding\": dmc.DEFAULT_THEME[\"spacing\"][\"lg\"]\n    }\n)\n```\nWhen using the `color` or other style props like `c`, `bd` or `bg` prop, you can use just the color.index:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Group([\n    dmc.Button(\"Button\", color=\"blue.3\"),\n    dmc.Button(\"Button\", variant=\"light\", color=\"blue.3\"),\n    dmc.Button(\"Button\", variant=\"outline\", color=\"blue.3\")\n])\n```\n### Colors as CSS Variables\n\nMantine also exposes colors as CSS variables. A complete list of Mantine CSS variables is available in the \n[Mantine Docs](https://mantine.dev/styles/css-variables-list/).\n\nIf you define custom colors in the `theme` object (via the `MantineProvider` component), these will also be included as\nCSS variables.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import html\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    \" This is a blue theme\",\n    style={\n        \"backgroundColor\": \"var(--mantine-color-blue-1)\",\n        \"color\": \"var(--mantine-color-blue-9)\",\n        \"padding\": \"var(--mantine-spacing-lg)\",\n    }\n)\n```\n\n### Adding extra colors\nYou can add any number of extra colors to `theme.colors` object. This will allow you to use them in all components that\nsupport color prop, for example `Button`, `Badge` and `Switch`.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    theme={\n        \"colors\": {\n            \"myColor\": [                \n              \"#F2FFB6\",\n              \"#DCF97E\",\n              \"#C3E35B\",\n              \"#AAC944\",\n              \"#98BC20\",\n              \"#86AC09\",\n              \"#78A000\",\n              \"#668B00\",\n              \"#547200\",\n              \"#455D00\",                \n            ]\n        },\n    },\n    children=[dmc.Button(\"Custom Colors!\", color=\"myColor\")],\n)\n```\n### Changing colors\n\nYou can override named theme colors as well, by providing your own list of 10 colors\n\n```python\n\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    theme={\n        \"colors\": {\n            \"blue\": [... ] # your 10 colors for \"blue\" theme color\n        }\n    }\n)\n```\n\n> 10 shades per color\n>\n> Colors override must include at least 10 shades per color. Otherwise, you will get a TypeScript error and some \n> variants will not have proper colors. If you only have one color value, you can either pick the remaining colors \n> manually or use the [colors generator tool](https://mantine.dev/colors-generator/).\n> \n> You can add more than 10 shades per color: these values will not be used by Mantine components with the default \n> colors resolver, but you can still reference them by index, for example, color=\"blue.11\".\n\n\n\n### Supported color formats\nYou can use the following color formats in theme.colors:\n\n- HEX: `#fff`, `#ffffff`\n- RGB: `rgb(255, 255, 255)`, `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)`\n- HSL: `hsl(0, 0%, 100%)`, `hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.5)`\n- OKLCH: `oklch(96.27% 0.0217 238.66)`, `oklch(96.27% 0.0217 238.66 / 0.5)`\n\n### Changing Theme Object defaults\n\nYou can change the defaults for `primaryColor` and `primaryShade` in the [theme object](/theme-object) in the\n`MantineProvider` component.\n\n#### primaryColor\n\nThe value of `theme.primaryColor` must be defined as key of `theme.colors`, it is used:\n\n- As a default value for most of the components that support color prop\n- To set default focus ring outline color\n\nYou can customize the primary color by changing it from its default value of `blue` to another predefined theme color.  \n\nThis example changed the default primary color to `green`:\n\n```python\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    theme={\"primaryColor\": \"green\"},\n    children=[] # your layout here\n    \n)\n```\n\n\n> Note You cannot assign CSS color values to `defaultColor`  It must be a defined color in the `theme` object.\n\n\n\n#### primaryShade\n\n`theme.primaryShade` is a number from 0 to 9. It determines which shade will be used for the components that have color prop.\n\n```python\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    theme={\"primaryShade\": 3},\n    children=dmc.Group([\n        dmc.Button(\"Button\",),\n        dmc.Button(\"Button\", variant=\"light\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Button\", variant=\"outline\")\n    ])\n    \n)\n```\n\nYou can also customize primary shade for dark and light color schemes separately (This is the default):\n\n\n```python\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    theme={\"primaryShade\": { \"light\": 6, \"dark\": 8 }},\n    children=[] # your layout here\n    \n)\n```\n\n### Color prop\nComponents that support changing their color have color prop. This prop supports the following values:\n\n- Key of `theme.colors`, for example, `blue` or `green`\n- Key of `theme.colors` with color index, for example, `blue.5` or `green.9`\n- CSS color value, for example, #fff or rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent= dmc.Box([\n    dmc.Text(\"Filled variant\", size=\"sm\", mb=5, fw=500),\n    dmc.Group([\n        dmc.Button(\"Theme color\", color=\"cyan\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Hex color\", color=\"#1D72FE\")\n    ]),\n\n    dmc.Text(\"Light variant\", size=\"sm\", mb=5, mt=\"md\", fw=500),\n    dmc.Group([\n        dmc.Button(\"Theme color\", variant=\"light\", color=\"cyan\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Hex color\", variant=\"light\", color=\"#1D72FE\")\n    ]),\n\n    dmc.Text(\"Outline variant\", size=\"sm\", mb=5, mt=\"md\", fw=500),\n    dmc.Group([\n        dmc.Button(\"Theme color\", variant=\"outline\", color=\"cyan\"),\n        dmc.Button(\"Hex color\", variant=\"outline\", color=\"#1D72FE\")\n    ])\n])\n```\n### Colors index reference\nYou can reference colors by index in `color` prop and style props, for example `c` prop:\n\n\n```python\ndmc.Text(\"Text with blue.5 color\", c=\"blue.5\")\ndmc.Button(\"Button\", color=\"blue.5\")\n```\n\n### Difference between color and c props\n`color` prop is used to control multiple CSS properties of the component. These properties can vary across different\ncomponents, but usually `color` prop controls `background`, `color` and `border-color` CSS properties. For example,\nwhen you set `color='#C3FF36'` on `Button` component (with `variant='filled'`), it will set the following CSS properties:\n\n- `background-color` to `#C3FF36`\n- `background-color` when button is hovered to `#B0E631` (`#C3FF36` darkened by 10%)\n- color to `var(--mantine-color-white)`\n- `border-color` to `transparent`\n\n`c` is a [style prop](/style-props) – it is responsible for setting a single CSS property `color` (color of the text). \nYou can combine both props to achieve better contrast between text and background. In the following example:\n\n- `color` prop sets all background: #C3FF36 and color: `var(--mantine-color-white)`\n- `c` prop overrides color styles to `color: var(--mantine-color-black)`\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Button(\"Button with color and c props\",  color=\"#C3FF36\", c=\"black\")\n```\n### Colors in light and dark mode\n\n#### Using light-dark() CSS Function\nThe [light-dark()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/light-dark) function allows defining different styles for light and dark color schemes.\n\n```css\nbackground-color: light-dark(white, black);\n```\n\n- The first argument applies in light mode.\n- The second argument applies in dark mode.\n\nNote that the light-dark() function is not supported in older browsers.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n\n    dmc.Text(\n        \"Click the theme switch in the header to see how the background changes in different modes:\"\n    ),\n    # Using CSS color names\n    dmc.Text(\n        \"light-dark(whitesmoke, gray)\",\n        style={\"backgroundColor\": \"light-dark(whitesmoke, gray)\"},\n        p=\"lg\",\n        m=\"md\"\n    ),\n    # Using Mantine CSS variables\n    dmc.Text(\n        \"light-dark(var(--mantine-color-blue-1), var(--mantine-color-blue-9))\",\n        style={\"backgroundColor\": \"light-dark(var(--mantine-color-blue-1), var(--mantine-color-blue-9))\"},\n        p=\"lg\",\n        m=\"md\"\n    )\n])\n```\n#### CSS Class Names for Light/Dark Mode\n\nSince light-dark() is not supported in older browsers, you can use class-based styling instead:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n\n    dmc.Text(\n        \"Click the theme switch in the header to see how the background changes in different modes\"\n    ),\n    dmc.Text(\n        \"CSS class defined for light and dark scheme\",\n        className=\"light-dark-demo\",\n        p=\"lg\",\n        m=\"md\"\n    ),\n])\n```\n\n```css\n/* applied in light color-scheme */\n.light-dark-demo {\n    background-color: #ffec99\n}\n\n/* applied in dark color-scheme */\n [data-mantine-color-scheme='dark'] .light-dark-demo {\n     background-color: #ff6b6b\n}\n\n\n\n/*\nYou can also use mantine colors\n\n.light-dark-demo {\n    background-color: var(--mantine-color-blue-1)\n}\n\n[data-mantine-color-scheme='dark'] .light-dark-demo {\n     background-color:  var(--mantine-color-blue-1)\n*/\n```\n\n\n#### CSS Variables for Light/Dark Mode\n\nDefining CSS variables on the `:root` element allows global styling across your app, including the `body` element.\n\nHere is an example using a CSS variable:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n\n    dmc.Text(\n        \"Click the theme switch in the header to see how the background changes in different modes:\"\n    ),\n    dmc.Text(\n        \"CSS variable defined for light and dark scheme\",\n        style={\"backgroundColor\": \"var(--my-light-dark-colors\"},\n        p=\"lg\",\n        m=\"md\"\n    ),\n])\n```\n\n```css\n\n:root {\n  --my-light-dark-colors: aliceblue;\n}\n\n:root[data-mantine-color-scheme=\"dark\"] {\n  --my-light-dark-colors: blue;\n}\n\n/*\nYou can also use mantine colors\n\n:root {\n  --my-light-dark-colors: var(--mantine-color-blue-1);\n}\n\n:root[data-mantine-color-scheme=\"dark\"] {\n  --my-light-dark-colors: var(--mantine-color-blue-1);\n}\n*/\n\n\n/*\nThe  --mantine-color-body CSS variable is used for body background and as background color\n of some components (Modal, Paper, etc.).  You can change it like this:\n\n:root {\n  --mantine-color-body: #f9f9f9;\n}\n\n:root[data-mantine-color-scheme=\"dark\"] {\n  --mantine-color-body: #333;\n}\n\n\n*/\n```\n\n\n### Default colors\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncolors = dmc.DEFAULT_THEME[\"colors\"]\n\ncomponent= dmc.SimpleGrid([\n    dmc.Card([\n        dmc.Box(h=100, w=100, bg=f\"{c}.{i}\" ),\n        dmc.Text(f\"{c} {i}\", size=\"sm\"),\n        dmc.Text(f\"{colors[c][i]}\", size=\"sm\", c=\"dimmed\")\n    ])  for c in list(colors) for i in range(10)\n], cols={ \"base\": 5,  \"lg\": 10 }, spacing=\"xs\")\n```\n### Default colors: CSS Variables list\n\nFor a list of all Mantine CSS variables that are generated from default theme, see the [CSS Variables](/css-variables/) section."

Templates include pre-defined color schemes, font styles, and layout configurations.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [Plotly templates documentation](https://plotly.com/python/templates/).\n\nBelow is an example using Plotly's built-in `plotly_white` and `plotly_dark` templates.  This is the same figure\nstyled for a light and dark theme.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import dcc\nimport plotly.express as px\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\ndff = df[df.year == 2007]\n\ncomponent = dmc.SimpleGrid(\n    [\n        dcc.Graph(figure=px.bar(dff, x=\"continent\", y=\"pop\", template=\"plotly_white\", title=\"plotly_white theme\")),\n        dcc.Graph(figure=px.bar(dff, x=\"continent\", y=\"pop\", template=\"plotly_dark\", title=\"plotly_dark theme\"))\n    ],\n    cols=2\n)\n```\n### Mantine-Themed Plotly Templates\n\nTo make Plotly figures consistent with Mantine's default theme, Dash Mantine Components provides two custom Plotly templates:\n\n- **`mantine_light`**: Based on `plotly_white` and styled with Mantine's light theme.  \n- **`mantine_dark`**: Based on `plotly_dark` and styled with Mantine's dark theme.  \n\nThese templates are created and registered using the `add_figure_templates` function. They include:  \n- Color palettes from Mantine’s theme.  \n- Fonts (`Inter` by default).  \n- Background and grid colors that match Mantine’s styles.  \n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import dcc\nimport plotly.express as px\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\ndff = df[df.year == 2007]\n\ndmc.add_figure_templates()\n\n\ncomponent = dmc.SimpleGrid(\n    [\n        dcc.Graph(figure=px.bar(dff, x=\"continent\", y=\"pop\", template=\"mantine_light\", title=\"mantine_light theme\" )),\n        dcc.Graph(figure=px.bar(dff, x=\"continent\", y=\"pop\", template=\"mantine_dark\",  title=\"mantine_dark theme\"))\n    ],\n    cols=2\n)\n```\n### Setting a Default Template\nYou can globally set either `mantine_light` or `mantine_dark` as the default Plotly template. This ensures all figures\nuse the specified template unless explicitly overridden.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n# Set \"mantine_dark\" as the default template\ndmc.add_figure_templates(default=\"mantine_dark\")\n```\n\n\n### Modifying Existing Plotly Templates\nThe `mantine_light` and `mantine_dark` templates can be customized like any other Plotly template. Refer to the\n[Plotly templates documentation](https://plotly.com/python/templates/) for more info and examples.\n\n```python\nimport plotly.io as pio\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.add_figure_templates()\n\n# Access the registered Mantine light template\ntemplate = pio.templates[\"mantine_light\"]\n\n# Reduce the margins in the template\ntemplate.layout.margin = dict(l=20, r=20, t=20, b=20)\n\nfig = px.scatter(px.data.gapminder(), x=\"gdpPercap\", y=\"lifeExp\", template=\"mantine_light\")\n\n\n\n```\n\n### Customizing `add_figure_templates` Function\nThe `add_figure_templates` function is available starting in DMC version 0.15.1.\nIf you are using an earlier version, or if you are using a custom Mantine theme, you can include your own `add_figure_templates` implementation in your project.\n\nExample Project Structure:\n```bash\nmy_project/  \n├── app.py  \n├── my_figure_templates.py  \n```\n\nIn `my_figure_templates.py`:\n\nCopy the `add_figure_templates` code from the [Dash Mantine Components GitHub](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/blob/master/dash_mantine_components/figure_templates.py) \nrepository and modify it to fit your project's requirements.\n\nIn `app.py`:\n```python\nfrom my_figure_templates import add_figure_templates\n\n# Register custom templates\nadd_figure_templates()\n```\n\nIn the [Help Center](https://github.com/snehilvj/dmc-docs/tree/main/help_center/theme_switch_figure_templates_custom) you'll find a complete minimal example of a custom figure template with a green primary color.\n\n### Using a Theme Switcher\n\nTo update the figure when switching themes, you need to change the Plotly template in a callback.\n\n\n> For more information on adding a theme switcher to your app, check the [Theme Switch Component](/theme-switch) section.\n\nThe example below uses this app's  theme switch component in the callback.  Try it out by clicking the **theme switch** in the header!\n\nSee a complete minimal example in the [Help Center](https://github.com/snehilvj/dmc-docs/tree/main/help_center/theme_switch_figure_templates_simple)\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import dcc, Input, Output, callback\nimport plotly.express as px\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\ndff = df[df.year == 2007]\n\ndmc.add_figure_templates()\n\n# Theme switch in the dmc-docs header:\n# dmc.Switch(\n#     offLabel=DashIconify(icon=\"radix-icons:sun\", width=15, color= \"var(--mantine-color-yellow-8)\"),\n#     onLabel=DashIconify(icon=\"radix-icons:moon\", width=15, color= \"var(--mantine-color-yellow-6)\"),\n#     id=\"docs-color-scheme-switch\",\n#     persistence=True,\n#     color=\"grey\",\n# )\ncomponent = dcc.Graph(id=\"figure-templates-histogram\")\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"figure-templates-histogram\", \"figure\"),\n    Input(\"docs-color-scheme-switch\", \"checked\"),\n)\ndef update_figure(switch_on):\n    template = \"mantine_dark\" if switch_on else \"mantine_light\"\n    return px.bar(dff, x=\"continent\", y=\"pop\", title=\"Population by Continent\", template=template)\n```\nFor better performance, you can update the figure template using [Partial Property Updates.](https://dash.plotly.com/partial-properties)\n\nHere is the callback updated to use `Patch` to change the figure template.  Note that when using `Patch` you must use the template\nobject rather than just the string name.  \n\n```python\n\nfrom dash import  Input, Output, callback, Patch\nimport plotly.io as pio\n\n\n@callback(\n    Output(\"figure-templates-bar\", \"figure\"),\n    Input(\"docs-color-scheme-switch\", \"checked\"),\n)\ndef update_figure(switch_on):\n    # template must be template object rather than just the template string name\n    template = pio.templates[\"mantine_dark\"] if switch_on else pio.templates[\"mantine_light\"]\n    patched_fig = Patch()\n    patched_fig[\"layout\"][\"template\"] = template\n    return patched_fig\n```\n\n### Updating multiple figures\n\nTo update multiple figure when switching themes, you can use [Pattern Matching Callbacks.](https://dash.plotly.com/pattern-matching-callbacks)\n \nThe example below uses this app's  theme switch component in the callback.  Try it out by clicking the **theme switch** in the header!\n\nSee a complete minimal example in the [Help Center](https://github.com/snehilvj/dmc-docs/tree/main/help_center/theme_switch_figure_templates)\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import  dcc, Input, Output, State, callback, Patch, ALL\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.io as pio\n\ndmc.add_figure_templates(default=\"mantine_light\")\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nline_fig = px.line(\n    df.query(\"1952 <= year <= 1982 & continent != 'Asia'\"),\n    x=\"year\",\n    y=\"gdpPercap\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    line_group=\"country\"\n)\n\ndff = df[df.year == 2007]\nscatter_fig = px.scatter(\n    dff,\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n    title=f\"2007 GDP per Capita vs Life Expectancy, Sized by Population \",\n)\n\n\navg_lifeExp = (dff[\"lifeExp\"] * dff[\"pop\"]).sum() / dff[\"pop\"].sum()\nmap_fig = px.choropleth(\n    dff,\n    locations=\"iso_alpha\",\n    color=\"lifeExp\",\n    title=\"%.0f World Average Life Expectancy was %.1f years\" % (2007, avg_lifeExp),\n)\n\nbar_fig = px.bar(dff, x=\"continent\", y=\"pop\", title=\"Population by Continent\")\n\ngraphs = dmc.Grid(\n    [\n        dmc.GridCol(dcc.Graph(figure=bar_fig, id={\"type\": \"graph\", \"index\": \"bar\"}), span={\"base\": 12, \"md\":6}),\n        dmc.GridCol(dcc.Graph(figure=scatter_fig, id={\"type\": \"graph\", \"index\": \"scatter\"}), span={\"base\": 12, \"md\":6}),\n        dmc.GridCol(dcc.Graph(figure=line_fig, id={\"type\": \"graph\", \"index\": \"line\"}), span={\"base\": 12, \"md\":6}),\n        dmc.GridCol(dcc.Graph(figure=map_fig, id={\"type\": \"graph\", \"index\": \"map\"}), span={\"base\": 12, \"md\":6}),\n    ],\n    gutter=\"xl\",\n)\n\nsample_controls = dmc.Box([\n    dmc.Button(\"sample button\"),\n    dmc.Button(\"sample red button\", color=\"red\"),\n    dmc.Button(\"sample yellow button\", color=\"yellow\"),\n    dmc.Slider(value=25, my=\"lg\"),\n], w=600)\n\n# used in the children prop of  MantinePovider([], id=\"m2d-mantine-provider)\ncomponent = dmc.Box([sample_controls, graphs])\n\n@callback(\n    Output({\"type\": \"graph\", \"index\": ALL}, \"figure\"),\n    Input(\"docs-color-scheme-switch\", \"checked\"),\n    State({\"type\": \"graph\", \"index\": ALL}, \"id\"),\n)\ndef update_figure(switch_on, ids):\n    # template must be template object rather than just the template string name\n    template = pio.templates[\"mantine_dark\"] if switch_on else pio.templates[\"mantine_light\"]\n    patched_figures = []\n    for i in ids:\n        patched_fig = Patch()\n        patched_fig[\"layout\"][\"template\"] = template\n        patched_figures.append(patched_fig)\n\n    return patched_figures\n```"

If you’re new to Dash Mantine Components,\nstart with the default theme. You can customize the theme globally by editing the `theme` prop in the `MantineProvider`.\n\nThe `theme` object is a dictionary where you can set things like colors, border radius, spacing, fonts, and breakpoints.\nMantine will merge your custom theme with the defaults, so you just need to provide what you want to change.\n\nThis example demonstrates how changing the `theme` updates the entire app’s appearance. Here, we change:\n- Primary accent color\n- Border radius\n- Card shadow style\n- Color scheme (light/dark)\n\nTry it live: [DMC Theme Builder on Pycafe](https://py.cafe/app/dash.mantine.components/dash-mantine-theme-builder)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n### Usage\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    theme={\n        # add your colors\n        \"colors\": {\n             # add your colors\n            \"deepBlue\": [\"#E9EDFC\", \"#C1CCF6\", \"#99ABF0\" \"...\"], # 10 colors\n            # or replace default theme color\n            \"blue\": [\"#E9EDFC\", \"#C1CCF6\", \"#99ABF0\" \"...\"],   # 10 colors\n        },\n        \"shadows\": {\n            # other shadows (xs, sm, lg) will be merged from default theme\n            \"md\": \"1px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.25)\",\n            \"xl\": \"5px 5px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.25)\",\n        },\n        \"headings\": {\n            \"fontFamily\": \"Roboto, sans-serif\",\n            \"sizes\": {\n                \"h1\": {\"fontSize\": '30px'},\n            },\n        },\n    },\n    children=[\n        # your app layout here\n    ],\n)\n```\n\n\n### Theme properties\nYou can find a complete list of all theme properties in the theme object in the references section at the bottom of the \npage. In the next section, we’ll focus on a few key properties to explain them in more detail.\n\n#### Colors\n\nSee more information and examples in [Colors](/colors) section\n\n- `colors` adds colors or over-rides named theme colors\n- `primaryColor` sets the app's primary (default) accent color \n- `primaryShade` sets the app's primary shade in either light or dark mode\n\n#### Typography\n\nSee more information and examples in [Typography](/typography) section\n\n- `fontFamily` – controls font-family in all components except `Title`, `Code` and `Kbd`\n- `fontFamilyMonospace` – controls font-family of components that require monospace font: `Code`, `Kbd` and `CodeHighlight`\n- `headings.fontFamily` – controls font-family of h1-h6 tags in `Title`, fallbacks to `theme.fontFamily` if not defined\n- `fontSizes` - defines the font-size from `xs` to `xl`\n- `lineHeights` -defines `line-height` values for `Text` component, most other components use `theme.lineHeights.md` by default\n\n#### Breakpoints\n\nSee more information and examples in [Responsive Styles](/responsive-styles) section\n\n#### autoContrast\n`autoContrast` controls whether text color should be changed based on the given color prop in the following components:\n\n* `ActionIcon` with `variant='filled'` only\n* `Alert` with `variant='filled'` only\n* `Avatar` with `variant='filled'` only\n* `Badge` with `variant='filled'` only\n* `Button` with `variant='filled'` only\n* `Chip` with `variant='filled'` only\n* `NavLink` with `variant='filled'` only\n* `ThemeIcon` with `variant='filled'` only\n* `Checkbox` with `variant='filled'` only\n* `Radio` with `variant='filled'` only\n* `Tabs` with `variant='filled'` only\n* `SegmentedControl`\n* `Stepper`\n* `Pagination`\n* `Progress`\n* `Indicator`\n* `Timeline`\n* `Spotlight`\n* All dates components that are based on Calendar component\n\n`autoContrast` checks whether the given color luminosity is above or below the `luminanceThreshold` value and changes text color to either `theme.white` or `theme.black` accordingly.\n\n`autoContrast` can be set globally on the theme level or individually for each component via `autoContrast` prop, except for dates components which only support global theme setting.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n    dmc.Code(\"autoContrast=True\"),\n    dmc.Group(\n        [\n            dmc.Button(\"Lime.4 button\", color=\"lime.4\", autoContrast=True),\n            dmc.Button(\"Blue.2 button\", color=\"blue.2\", autoContrast=True),\n            dmc.Button(\"Orange.3 button\", color=\"orange.3\", autoContrast=True),\n        ],\n        mt=\"xs\",\n        mb=\"lg\"\n    ),\n    dmc.Code(\"autoContrast=False\"),\n    dmc.Group(\n        [\n            dmc.Button(\"Lime.4 button\", color=\"lime.4\"),\n            dmc.Button(\"Blue.2 button\", color=\"blue.2\"),\n            dmc.Button(\"Orange.3 button\", color=\"orange.3\"),\n        ],\n        mt=\"xs\"\n    )\n])\n```\n#### luminanceThreshold\n\n`luminanceThreshold` controls which luminance value is used to determine if text color should be light or dark. It is \nused only if `theme.autoContrast` is set to `True`. Default value is 0.3.\n\nSee a live demo of `luminanceThreshold` in the [Mantine Docs](https://mantine.dev/theming/theme-object/#luminancethreshold)\n\n```python\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    dmc.Group([\n        dmc.Button(\"button\", color=f\"blue.{i}\") for i in range(10)\n    ]),\n    theme={\n        \"luminanceThreshold\": .45,\n        \"autoContrast\": True\n    }\n)\n```\n\n#### focusRing\n`theme.focusRing` controls focus ring styles, it supports the following values:\n\n- 'auto' (default and recommended) – focus ring is visible only when the user navigates with keyboard, this is the default browser behavior for native interactive elements\n- 'always' – focus ring is visible when user navigates with keyboard and mouse, for example, the focus ring will be visible when user clicks on a button\n- 'never' – focus ring is always hidden, it is not recommended – users who navigate with keyboard will not have visual indication of the current focused element\n\n\nSee a live demo of `focusRing` in the [Mantine Docs](https://mantine.dev/theming/theme-object/#focusring)\n\n#### focusClassName\n\n`theme.focusClassName` is a CSS class that is added to elements that have focus styles, for example, `Button` or \n`ActionIcon`. It can be used to customize focus ring styles of all interactive components except inputs. Note that when\n`theme.focusClassName` is set, `theme.focusRing` is ignored.\n\nSee a live demo of `focusClassName` in the [Mantine Docs](https://mantine.dev/theming/theme-object/#focusclassname)\n\n```python\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    dmc.Button(\"click button to see focus ring\", m=\"lg\"),\n    theme={\"focusClassName\": \"focus\"}\n)\n```\nDefine the class in the `.css` file in `/assets` folder\n```css\n\n/* Use `&:focus` when you want focus ring to be visible when control is clicked */\n.focus {\n  &:focus {\n    outline: 2px solid var(--mantine-color-red-filled);\n    outline-offset: 3px;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n#### activeClassName\n`theme.activeClassName` is a CSS class that is added to elements that have active styles, for example, `Button` or\n`ActionIcon`. It can be used to customize active styles of all interactive components.\n\nTo disable active styles for all components, set `theme.activeClassName` to an empty string.\n\n\nSee a live demo of `activeClassName` in the [Mantine Docs](https://mantine.dev/theming/theme-object/#activeclassname)\n\n#### defaultRadius \n\n`theme.defaultRadius` controls the default border-radius property in most components, for example, `Button` or `TextInput`.\nYou can set to either one of the values from `theme.radius` or a number/string to use exact value. Note that numbers are\ntreated as pixels, but converted to rem. For example, `{'defaultRadius': 4}` will be converted to 0.25rem. You can learn\nmore about rem conversion in the [rem units guide](https://mantine.dev/styles/rem/).\n\n\nSee a live demo of `defaultRadius` in the [Mantine Docs](https://mantine.dev/theming/theme-object/#defaultradius)\n\n```python\n\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    dmc.Box([\n        dmc.Button(\"Button\", m=\"sm\"),\n        dmc.TextInput(m=\"sm\", label=\"TextInput with defaultRadius\", placeholder=\"TextInput with default radius\")\n    ]),\n    theme={\"defaultRadius\": \"xl\"},    \n)\n```\n\n#### cursorType\n`theme.cursorType` controls the default cursor type for interactive elements, that do not have cursor: pointer styles \nby default. For example, `Checkbox`.\n\n\nSee a live demo of `cursorType` in the [Mantine Docs](https://mantine.dev/theming/theme-object/#cursortype)\n\n\n```python\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    dmc.Checkbox(label=\"Pointer cursor\", mt=\"md\"),\n    theme={\"cursorType\": 'pointer'},    \n)\n```\n\n#### defaultGradient\n`theme.defaultGradient` controls the default gradient configuration for components that support `variant='gradient'`\n(Button, ActionIcon, Badge, etc.).\n\n\nSee a live demo of `defaultGradient` in the [Mantine Docs](https://mantine.dev/theming/theme-object/#defaultgradient)\n\n```python\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    dmc.Button(\"Button with custom default gradient\", variant=\"gradient\"),\n    theme={\n        \"defaultGradient\": {\n            \"from\": 'orange',\n            \"to\": 'red',\n            \"deg\": 45,\n          },\n    }  \n)\n```\n#### components defaultProps\n\nDefault props  \n\nYou can define default props for every Mantine component by setting `theme.components`. These props will be used by\ndefault by all components of your application unless they are overridden by component props.\n\nSee a live demo of `defaultProps` in the [Mantine Docs](https://mantine.dev/theming/default-props/)\n\n\n```python\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    dmc.Group(\n        [\n            dmc.Button(\"Default button\"),\n            dmc.Button(\"Button with props\", color=\"red\", variant=\"filled\"),\n        ]\n    ),\n    theme={\n        \"components\": {\n            \"Button\": {\n                \"defaultProps\": {\n                    \"color\": \"cyan\",\n                    \"variant\": \"outline\",\n                },\n            },\n        },\n    }\n)\n```\n\n#### components custom variants\n\nSee how to add custom variants to `ActionIcon` and `Button` in the theme object, making these variants available globally\nacross your app. Detailed examples are provided in their respective documentation sections.  Also, see examples live:\n\n- [Live Demo: Button Variants on PyCafe](https://py.cafe/dash.mantine.components/button-custom-variants-demo-0)  \n- [Live Demo: ActionIcon Variants on PyCafe](https://py.cafe/dash.mantine.components/actionicon-custom-variants-demo)  \n\n#### components custom sizes\n\nSee and example of adding custom sizes in the  [Checkbox](/components/checkbox) section.  Also see a live dome on PyCafe:\n\n- [Live Demo: Checkbox Sizes PyCafe](https://py.cafe/dash.mantine.components/checkbox-custom-sizes-demo) \n\n#### other \n\n`theme.other` is an object that can be used to store any other properties that you want to access with the theme objects.\n\n```python\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    # your app layout,\n    theme={\n        \"other\": {\n            \"charcoal\": \"#333333\",\n            \"primaryHeadingSize\": 45,\n            \"fontWeights\": {\n                \"bold\": 700,\n                \"extraBold\": 900,\n            },\n        },\n    }\n)\n```\n\n\n### Usage in DMC docs\n\nMantineProvider is used to customize theme for these docs as well. The theming is more or less inline with below.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n     forceColorScheme=\"light\",\n     theme={\n         \"primaryColor\": \"indigo\",\n         \"fontFamily\": \"'Inter', sans-serif\",\n         \"components\": {\n             \"Button\": {\"defaultProps\": {\"fw\": 400}},\n             \"Alert\": {\"styles\": {\"title\": {\"fontWeight\": 500}}},\n             \"AvatarGroup\": {\"styles\": {\"truncated\": {\"fontWeight\": 500}}},\n             \"Badge\": {\"styles\": {\"root\": {\"fontWeight\": 500}}},\n             \"Progress\": {\"styles\": {\"label\": {\"fontWeight\": 500}}},\n             \"RingProgress\": {\"styles\": {\"label\": {\"fontWeight\": 500}}},\n             \"CodeHighlightTabs\": {\"styles\": {\"file\": {\"padding\": 12}}},\n             \"Table\": {\n                 \"defaultProps\": {\n                     \"highlightOnHover\": True,\n                     \"withTableBorder\": True,\n                     \"verticalSpacing\": \"sm\",\n                     \"horizontalSpacing\": \"md\",\n                 }\n             },\n         },\n     },\n     children=[\n         # content\n     ],\n )\n```\n\n### Default theme\n\nDefault theme is available as `dmc.DEFAULT_THEME`. It includes all theme properties with default values. \nWhen you pass theme override to MantineProvider, it will be deeply merged with the default theme.\n\n### Theme Object Reference\n\n| **Name**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                | **Type**                         |\n|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------|\n| `focusRing`            | Controls focus ring styles.

The `Switch`\nis set with `persistence=True` to retain the selected theme even after a browser refresh.\n\nThis is the theme switch used in these docs.  Click on the switch in the header to change themes.\n\nHere is a complete minimal example:\n\n```python\n\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash_iconify import DashIconify\nfrom dash import Dash, Input, Output,  clientside_callback\n\n\ntheme_toggle = dmc.Switch(\n    offLabel=DashIconify(icon=\"radix-icons:sun\", width=15, color= \"var(--mantine-color-yellow-8)\"),\n    onLabel=DashIconify(icon=\"radix-icons:moon\", width=15, color= \"var(--mantine-color-yellow-6)\"),\n    id=\"color-scheme-switch\",\n    persistence=True,\n    color=\"grey\",\n)\n\napp = Dash()\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    [theme_toggle, dmc.Text(\"Your page content\")],\n)\n\nclientside_callback(\n    \"\"\"\n    (switchOn) => {\n       document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-mantine-color-scheme', switchOn ?

    "content": "\n\n## Typography  \nHow to set fonts, size and line height in the app theme  \nCategory: Theming  \n\n### Change fonts\n\nYou can change fonts and other text styles for headings, code and all other components with the following theme properties:\n\n- `theme.fontFamily` – controls font-family in all components except `Title`, `Code` and `Kbd`\n- `theme.fontFamilyMonospace` – controls font-family of components that require monospace font: `Code`, `Kbd` and `CodeHighlight`\n- `theme.headings.fontFamily` – controls font-family of h1-h6 tags in `Title`, fallbacks to `theme.fontFamily` if not defined\n\nIn this example, you can toggle between the default fonts and custom fonts specified in the `theme`.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nfrom dash import Dash, Input, Output\n\n\napp = Dash()\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box([\n    dmc.SegmentedControl(id=\"segment\", data=[\"default\", \"custom-fonts\"], value=\"default\"),\n    dmc.Box([\n        dmc.Title(\"Greycliff CF title\", order=3),\n        dmc.Button(\"Verdana button\"),\n        dmc.Code(\"Monaco, Courier Code\")\n    ], bd=True, m=\"lg\")\n], m=\"lg\")\n\ntheme= {\n  \"fontFamily\": 'Verdana',\n  \"fontFamilyMonospace\": 'Monaco, Courier, monospace',\n  \"headings\": { \"fontFamily\": 'Greycliff CF' },\n}\n\napp.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(\n    component,\n    id=\"provider\",\n)\n\n@app.callback(\n    Output(\"provider\", \"theme\"),\n    Input(\"segment\", \"value\")\n)\ndef update_font_theme(val):\n    if val == \"default\":\n        return {}\n    return theme\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### System fonts\nBy default, Mantine uses system fonts. It means that different devices will display components based on available font,\nfor example, macOS and iOS users will see San Francisco font, Windows users will see Segoe UI font, Android users will\nsee Roboto font and so on. This approach provides a familiar experience to the users and allows avoiding common problems \nrelated to custom fonts loading (layout shift, invisible text, etc.), if you do not have strict requirements, it is \nrecommended to use system fonts for better performance.\n\nDefault values for theme properties:\n\n- Default value for `theme.fontFamily` and `theme.headings.fontFamily` is `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji`\n- Default value for `theme.fontFamilyMonospace` is `ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, Liberation Mono, Courier New, monospace`\n\n\n### Font Sizes\n\nDefault `theme.fontSizes` Values\n\n| Key | Value      | Value in px |\n|-----|------------|-------------|\n| xs  | 0.75rem    | 12px        |\n| sm  | 0.875rem   | 14px        |\n| md  | 1rem       | 16px        |\n| lg  | 1.125rem   | 18px        |\n| xl  | 1.25rem    | 20px        |\n\nYou can customize the `fontSizes` defaults in the `theme`: \n```python\ntheme = {\n    \"fontSizes\" : {\n        \"xs\": \"0.75rem\",            # customize font sizes here\n        \"sm\": \"0.875rem\",\n        \"md\": \"1rem\",\n        \"lg\": \"1.125rem\",\n        \"xl\": \"1.25rem\",\n    }\n}\n\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    # your layout,\n    theme=theme\n)\n```\n\n### Line Heights\n\n`theme.lineHeights` property defines line-height values for `Text` component, most other components use \n`theme.lineHeights.md` by default:\n\n Default `theme.lineHeights` Values\n\n\n| Key | Value  |\n|-----|--------|\n| xs  | 1.4    |\n| sm  | 1.45   |\n| md  | 1.55   |\n| lg  | 1.6    |\n| xl  | 1.65   |\n\nYou can customize the `lineHeights` defaults in the `theme`:\n\n```python\ntheme = {\n    \"lineHeights\" : {\n        \"xs\": \"1.4\",            # customize line heights here\n        \"sm\": \"1.45\",\n        \"md\": \"1.55\",\n        \"lg\": \"1.6\",\n        \"xl\": \"1.65\",\n    }\n}\n\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    # your layout,\n    theme=theme\n)\n\n```\n\n### h1-h6 styles\nTo customize headings styles in `Title` components set `theme.headings`:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ntheme = {\n    \"headings\": {\n        # Properties for all headings\n        \"fontWeight\": \"400\",\n        \"fontFamily\": \"Roboto\",\n        # Properties for individual headings\n        \"sizes\": {\n            \"h1\": {\n                \"fontWeight\": \"100\",\n                \"fontSize\": \"36px\",\n                \"lineHeight\": \"1.4\",\n            },\n            \"h2\": {\n                \"fontSize\": \"30px\",\n                \"lineHeight\": \"1.5\",\n            },\n            # Additional heading levels\n            \"h6\": {\n                \"fontWeight\": \"900\",\n            },\n        },\n    },\n}\n\ndmc.MantineProvider(    \n    # your app layout here,\n    theme=theme,\n)\n```\n\nWith `theme.headings` you can customize `font-size`, `font-weight` and `line-height` per heading level. If you need\nmore control over styles, use `:is` selector with [Styles API](/styles-api) to target specific heading level:\n\nYou can find a complete minimal example in the [Help Center](https://github.com/snehilvj/dmc-docs/blob/main/help_center/theme/change_headings.py)\n\n```python\n\ntheme = {\n    \"components\": {\n        \"Title\": {\n            \"classNames\": {\n                \"root\": \"change-heading-demo\",\n            },\n        },\n    },\n}\n\ndmc.MantineProvider(\n    theme=theme,\n    children=[\n        dmc.Title(\"Heading 1\", order=1),\n        dmc.Title(\"Heading 2\", order=2),\n        dmc.Title(\"Heading 3\", order=3),\n        dmc.Title(\"Heading 4\", order=4),\n        dmc.Title(\"Heading 5\", order=5),\n        dmc.Title(\"Heading 6\", order=6),\n    ],\n)\n```\n\nIn a `.css` file in `/assets` folder add:\n\n```css\n\n.change-heading-demo {\n  &:is(h1) {\n    font-family: GreycliffCF, sans-serif;\n    font-weight: 900;\n  }\n\n  &:is(h5, h6) {\n    color: var(--mantine-color-dimmed);\n  }\n}\n\n```"

    "content": "\n\n## CodeHighlight  \nUse CodeHighlight component for highlighting code snippets with syntax highlighting for different languages like python, cpp, javascript, etc.  \nCategory: Typography  \n\n### CSS Extensions\n\nAs of DMC 1.2.0, `CodeHightlight` component styles are bundled automatically, so you no longer need to include a separate CSS file.\nIf you're using an older version of DMC, refer to the [migration guide](/migration) for instructions on including optional stylesheets.\n\n\n\n### Simple Usage\n\n`CodeHighlight` highlight given code with [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/), it accepts `code` prop with string of\ncode to highlight and `language` prop with language name. If language is not provided, `CodeHighlight` will assume that\nthe code language is `tsx` (TypeScript).\n\n`CodeHighlight` is used to show the code for all the examples in these docs.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.CodeHighlight(\n    language=\"python\",\n    code=\"\"\"# Kadane's Algorithm\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        curr, summ = nums[0], nums[0]\n        for n in nums[1:]:\n            curr = max(n, curr + n)\n            summ = max(summ, curr)\n        return summ\"\"\",\n)\n```\n### Supported Languages \n\nThe `CodeHighlight` components supports syntax highlighting for the top 10 most commonly used languages:\n\n* `python` / `py`\n* `javascript` / `js`\n* `typescript` / `ts`\n* `html` / `xml`\n* `css`\n* `json`\n* `yaml` / `yml`\n* `bash` / `sh`\n* `sql`\n* `markdown` / `md`\n\nIf you set `language=\"some-unsupported-lang\"`, the code will render with no syntax highlighting.\n\nIf you need support for a language not currently included, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository.](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/issues)\n\n### Copy button\nYou can customize copy button labels with `copyLabel` and `copiedLabel` props. In case you need to remove \nthe copy button, set `withCopyButton=False`.\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Stack([\n    dmc.CodeHighlight(\n        code = \"dmc.Text('This codeblock has a custom copy button label')\",\n        language=\"python\",\n        copyLabel=\"Copy button code\",\n        copiedLabel=\"Copied!\",\n    ),\n    dmc.CodeHighlight(\n            code = \"dmc.Text('This codeblock does not have a copy button')\",\n            language=\"python\",\n            withCopyButton=False,\n            mt=\"md\"\n        )\n])\n```\n### With tabs\n`CodeHighlightTabs` component allows organizing multiple code blocks into tabs:\n\nThe `code` prop is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary defines a tab. Each dictionary can include the following keys:\n\n- `fileName`: The label for the tab.\n- `code`: The code string to display in the tab.\n- `language`: The programming language for syntax highlighting.\n- `icon`: An optional component to display to the left of the fileName.\n\n\n```python\n\ncode = [\n    {\n        \"fileName\": \"demo.py\",\n        \"code\": demo_py, # your code string here\n        \"language\": \"python\",\n        \"icon\": DashIconify(icon=\"vscode-icons:file-type-python\", width=20), \n    },\n    {\n        \"fileName\": \"styles.css\",\n        \"code\":styles_css, # your code string here\n        \"language\": \"css\",\n        \"icon\": DashIconify(icon=\"vscode-icons:file-type-css\", width=20), \n    },    \n]\n\ndmc.CodeHighlightTabs(code=code)\n\n```\n\n### Expandable code\nIf the code snippet is too long, you can make it expandable with `withExpandButton` and `defaultExpanded=False` props.\nTo change label of the expand/collapse control tooltip, use `expandCodeLabel` and `collapseCodeLabel`.\n\nNote - the expandable code feature is only available in the  `CodeHighlightTabs` component.\n\n\n### Inline code\n\n`InlineCodeHighlight` component allows highlighting inline code snippets:\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Text(\n    [\n        \"You can highlight code inline \",\n        dmc.InlineCodeHighlight(\n            code='dmc.InlineCodeHighlight(code=\"Your code string here\", language=\"python\")',\n            language=\"python\",\n        ),\n        \" Is not that cool?\",\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API. With Styles API, you can customize styles of any inner element. See the Styling and Theming sections of these docs for more information.\n\n\n#### CodeHighlight Selectors\n\n| Selector | Static selector               | Description                          |\n|----------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| root     | .mantine-CodeHighlight-root    | Root element                         |\n| pre      | .mantine-CodeHighlight-pre     | Pre element, contains code element   |\n| code     | .mantine-CodeHighlight-code    | Code element                         |\n| copy     | .mantine-CodeHighlight-copy    | Copy button                          |\n\n\n\n#### CodeHighlightTabs Selectors\n\n| Selector      | Static selector                     | Description                                            |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| root          | .mantine-CodeHighlightTabs-root      | Root element                                           |\n| pre           | .mantine-CodeHighlightTabs-pre       | Pre element, contains code element                    |\n| codeWrapper   | .mantine-CodeHighlightTabs-codeWrapper | Wrapper around code element, used for expand/collapse logic |\n| code          | .mantine-CodeHighlightTabs-code      | Code element, contains highlighted code               |\n| header        | .mantine-CodeHighlightTabs-header    | Header element, contains copy button and file names   |\n| controls      | .mantine-CodeHighlightTabs-controls  | Controls container, contains control buttons (copy, collapse, etc.) |\n| control       | .mantine-CodeHighlightTabs-control   | Control button (copy, collapse, etc.)                 |\n| files         | .mantine-CodeHighlightTabs-files     | File names list                                       |\n| file          | .mantine-CodeHighlightTabs-file      | File name                                             |\n| fileIcon      | .mantine-CodeHighlightTabs-fileIcon  | File icon                                             |\n| showCodeButton| .mantine-CodeHighlightTabs-showCodeButton | Button that reveals full code when it is collapsed |\n\n\n#### InlineCodeHighlight Selectors\n\n| Selector | Static selector                    | Description    |\n|----------|-------------------------------------|----------------|\n| code     | .mantine-InlineCodeHighlight-code   | Root element   |\n\n\n### Keyword Arguments\n#### CodeHighlight\n\n- id (string; optional):\n    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.\n\n- aria-* (string; optional):\n    Wild card aria attributes.\n\n- attributes (boolean | number | string | dict | list; optional):\n    Passes attributes to inner elements of a component.

An alternative to html.Table  \nCategory: Typography  \n\n> Looking for advanced table capabilities? [Dash AG Grid](/dash-ag-grid) pairs well with DMC and supports editing, sorting, filtering, selecting, conditional formatting and much more.\n\n### Simple Example\n\nUse Table component to add Mantine styled tables in your app. use `dmc.Table` and associated components as\ndrop-in replacements for `html.Table` and associated components respectively.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\nelements = [\n    {\"position\": 6, \"mass\": 12.011, \"symbol\": \"C\", \"name\": \"Carbon\"},\n    {\"position\": 7, \"mass\": 14.007, \"symbol\": \"N\", \"name\": \"Nitrogen\"},\n    {\"position\": 39, \"mass\": 88.906, \"symbol\": \"Y\", \"name\": \"Yttrium\"},\n    {\"position\": 56, \"mass\": 137.33, \"symbol\": \"Ba\", \"name\": \"Barium\"},\n    {\"position\": 58, \"mass\": 140.12, \"symbol\": \"Ce\", \"name\": \"Cerium\"},\n]\n\nrows = [\n    dmc.TableTr(\n        [\n            dmc.TableTd(element[\"position\"]),\n            dmc.TableTd(element[\"name\"]),\n            dmc.TableTd(element[\"symbol\"]),\n            dmc.TableTd(element[\"mass\"]),\n        ]\n    )\n    for element in elements\n]\n\nhead = dmc.TableThead(\n    dmc.TableTr(\n        [\n            dmc.TableTh(\"Element Position\"),\n            dmc.TableTh(\"Element Name\"),\n            dmc.TableTh(\"Symbol\"),\n            dmc.TableTh(\"Atomic Mass\"),\n        ]\n    )\n)\nbody = dmc.TableTbody(rows)\ncaption = dmc.TableCaption(\"Some elements from periodic table\")\n\ncomponent = dmc.Table([head, body, caption])\n```\n### data prop\n\nYou can use `data` prop to automatically generate table rows from raw data. \n`data` prop accepts an object with the following properties: `head`, `foot`, `body`, `caption`:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Table(\n    data={\n        \"caption\": \"Some elements from periodic table\",\n        \"head\": [\"Element position\", \"Atomic mass\", \"Symbol\", \"Element name\"],\n        \"body\": [\n            [6, 12.011, \"C\", \"Carbon\"],\n            [7, 14.007, \"N\", \"Nitrogen\"],\n            [39, 88.906, \"Y\", \"Yttrium\"],\n            [56, 137.33, \"Ba\", \"Barium\"],\n            [58, 140.12, \"Ce\", \"Cerium\"],\n        ],\n    }\n)\n```\n### Spacing\n\nTo control spacing use `horizontalSpacing` and `verticalSpacing` props. Both props support spacing from Mantine's theme\nand number values to set cell padding in px.\n\n\n### Striped and Rows Hover\n\n\n### Scroll container\nTo prevent viewport overflow wrap `Table` with `TableScrollContainer`. The component accepts `minWidth` prop which sets\nminimum width below which table will be scrollable.\n\nBy default, `TableScrollContainer` uses `ScrollArea`, you can change it to native scrollbars by setting `type=\"native\"`\n\nYou can also set `maxHeight` prop on `TableScrollContainer` to limit table height\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nimport random\n\nrows = [\n    [\n        i + 1,\n        f\"S-{1000 + i}\",\n        round(random.uniform(15, 30), 1),   # Temperature °C\n        round(random.uniform(30, 70), 1),   # Humidity %\n    ]\n    for i in range(50)\n]\n\ncomponent = dmc.TableScrollContainer(\n    dmc.Table(\n        data={\n            \"caption\": \"Synthetic Sensor Readings\",\n            \"head\": [\"#\", \"Sensor ID\", \"Temperature (°C)\", \"Humidity (%)\"],\n            \"body\": rows,\n        },\n        striped=True,\n        highlightOnHover=True,\n        withTableBorder=True,\n    ),\n    maxHeight=300,\n    minWidth=600,\n    type=\"scrollarea\",\n)\n```\n### Vertical variant\nSet `variant=\"vertical\"` to render table with vertical layout:\n\n\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Table(\n    withTableBorder=True,\n    layout=\"fixed\",\n    variant=\"vertical\",\n    children=[\n        dmc.TableTbody([\n            dmc.TableTr([\n                dmc.TableTh(\"Epic name\", w=160),\n                dmc.TableTd(\"7.x migration\"),\n            ]),\n            dmc.TableTr([\n                dmc.TableTh(\"Status\"),\n                dmc.TableTd(\"Open\"),\n            ]),\n            dmc.TableTr([\n                dmc.TableTh(\"Total issues\"),\n                dmc.TableTd(\"135\"),\n            ]),\n            dmc.TableTr([\n                dmc.TableTh(\"Total story points\"),\n                dmc.TableTd(\"874\"),\n            ]),\n            dmc.TableTr([\n                dmc.TableTh(\"Last updated at\"),\n                dmc.TableTd(\"September 26, 2024 17:41:26\"),\n            ]),\n        ])\n    ]\n)\n```\n### tableProps\n\n\nUse `tableProps` to pass additional [HTML attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/table) \nto the underlying elements of a dmc.Table, such as `<td>`, `<tr>`, or `<th>`. This is useful when you need to control\nlayout behavior like `rowSpan`, `colSpan`.\n\nYou can pass tableProps to components like:\n```python\ndmc.TableTd(\"Monday\", tableProps={\"rowSpan\": 2})\n```\n\nThis example also shows how to include other dash components in table cells.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Table(\n    withTableBorder=True,\n    withColumnBorders=True,\n\n    children=[\n        dmc.TableThead(\n            dmc.TableTr([\n                dmc.TableTh(\"Day\"),\n                dmc.TableTh(\"Time\"),\n                dmc.TableTh(\"Topic\"),\n                dmc.TableTh(\"Action\"),\n            ])\n        ),\n        dmc.TableTbody([\n            dmc.TableTr([\n                dmc.TableTd(\"Monday\", tableProps={\"rowSpan\": 2}),\n                dmc.TableTd(\"9:00 - 10:00\"),\n                dmc.TableTd(\"Building Interactive Dashboards with Dash\"),\n                dmc.TableTd(dmc.Button(\"Details\", size=\"xs\", variant=\"light\")),\n            ]),\n            dmc.TableTr([\n                dmc.TableTd(\"10:15 - 11:00\"),\n                dmc.TableTd(\"Advanced Callbacks and App Structure\"),\n                dmc.TableTd(dmc.Button(\"Details\", size=\"xs\", variant=\"light\")),\n            ]),\n            dmc.TableTr([\n                dmc.TableTd(\"Tuesday\", tableProps={\"rowSpan\": 2}),\n                dmc.TableTd(\"9:00 - 10:00\"),\n                dmc.TableTd(\"Data Visualization with Plotly Express\"),\n                dmc.TableTd(dmc.Button(\"Details\", size=\"xs\", variant=\"light\")),\n            ]),\n            dmc.TableTr([\n                dmc.TableTd(\"10:15 - 11:00\"),\n                dmc.TableTd(\"Deploying Dash Apps to the Web\"),\n                dmc.TableTd(dmc.Button(\"Details\", size=\"xs\", variant=\"light\")),\n            ]),\n        ])\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Styles API\n\n\nThis component supports Styles API.

It sets color to theme.colors.dark[2] in dark theme and to \ntheme.colors.gray[6] in light.\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Text(\"Dimmed text\", c=\"dimmed\")\n```\n### Gradient\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Center(\n    children=[\n        dmc.Text(\n            \"Indigo cyan gradient\",\n            variant=\"gradient\",\n            gradient={\"from\": \"red\", \"to\": \"yellow\", \"deg\": 45},\n            style={\"fontSize\": 40},\n        )\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Truncate\n\nSet `truncate` prop to add `text-overflow: ellipsis styles`:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncontent = \"\"\"\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Unde provident eos fugiat id\nnecessitatibus magni ducimus molestias. Placeat, consequatur. Quisquam, quae magnam\nperspiciatis excepturi iste sint itaque sunt laborum. Nihil?\n\"\"\"\n\ncomponent = dmc.Box(\n    [\n        dmc.Title(\"truncate='end'\", order=5),\n        dmc.Text(content, truncate=\"end\"),\n        \n        dmc.Title(\"truncate='start'\", order=5, mt=\"lg\"),\n        dmc.Text(content, truncate=\"start\"),\n    ],\n    w=300\n)\n```\n### Lineclamp\n\nSpecify maximum number of lines with `lineClamp` prop. This option uses `-webkit-line-clamp` CSS property ([caniuse](https://caniuse.com/css-line-clamp)).\nNote that `padding-bottom` cannot be set on text element:\n\n### Inherit styles\n\n`Text` always applies `font-size`, `font-family` and `line-height` styles, but in some cases this is not a desired \nbehavior. To force `Text` to inherit parent styles set `inherit` prop. For example, highlight part of `Title`:\n\n```python\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\ncomponent = dmc.Title(\n    children = [\n        \"Title in which you want to \",\n        dmc.Text(\"highlight\", span=True, c=\"blue\", inherit=True),\n        \" something.\"\n    ]\n)\n```\n### span prop\nThe root element of `Text` is an HTML `p` component.

    "category": "Typography",
    "content": "\n\n## TypographyStylesProvider  \nStyles provider for html content  \nCategory: Typography  \n\n### Basic usage\n\nBy default, Mantine does not include global typography styles. To apply consistent styling to your HTML content, wrap it in `TypographyStylesProvider`.  \n\n```python\ndmc.TypographyStylesProvider(\n    html.H1(\"html components styled with a Mantine theme\")\n)\n```\n\nThe styles applied to `TypographyStylesProvider` children can be found in the [Mantine GitHub repository](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/blob/master/packages/%40mantine/core/src/components/Typography/Typography.module.css).  \n\n### Included Styles\n`TypographyStylesProvider` provides default styling for:  \n- Headings (`h1`-`h6`)  \n- Paragraphs (`p`)  \n- Lists (`ul`, `ol`)  \n- Blockquotes (`blockquote`)  \n- Tables (`table`)  \n- Links (`a`)  \n- Images (`img`)  \n- Horizontal rules (`hr`)  \n- Keyboard inputs (`kbd`)  \n- Code blocks (`code`, `pre`)  \n\n### Using with Dash html Components\n\nYou can use `TypographyStylesProvider` to apply Mantine's typography styles to Dash’s html components. Below is an example of styling a table:  \n\n```python\nfrom dash import  html\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/solar.csv')\n\ndef generate_table(dataframe, max_rows=10):\n    return html.Table([\n        html.Thead(\n            html.Tr([html.Th(col) for col in dataframe.columns])\n        ),\n        html.Tbody([\n            html.Tr([\n                html.Td(dataframe.iloc[i][col]) for col in dataframe.columns\n            ]) for i in range(min(len(dataframe), max_rows))\n        ])\n    ])\n\ncomponent = html.Div(\n    [\n        html.Div([\n            html.H4(\"Example without TypographyStylesProvider\"),\n            generate_table(df),\n        ], style={\"marginBottom\": 36}),\n\n        dmc.TypographyStylesProvider([\n            html.H4(\"Example with TypographyStylesProvider\"),\n            generate_table(df),\n        ]),\n    ]\n)\n```\n### Using with dcc.Markdown\n\nIf you are rendering content from the [RichTextEditor](/components/richtexteditor) in `dcc.Markdown`, you can wrap it in `TypographyStylesProvider` to ensure it adopts Mantine’s typography styles.  \n\n```python\nfrom dash import  dcc\nimport dash_mantine_components as dmc\n\n\n# Content from the RichTextEditor example.\ncontent = \"\"\"<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Welcome to Mantine rich text editor</h2><p><code>RichTextEditor</code> component focuses on usability and is designed to be as simple as possible to bring a familiar editing experience to regular users. <code>RichTextEditor</code> is based on <a href=\"https://tiptap.dev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tiptap.dev</a> and supports all of its features:</p><ul><li>General text formatting: <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, <u>underline</u>, <s>strike-through</s> </li><li>Headings (h1-h6)</li><li>Sub and super scripts (<sup>&lt;sup /&gt;</sup> and <sub>&lt;sub /&gt;</sub> tags)</li><li>Ordered and bullet lists</li><li>Text align&nbsp;</li><li>And all <a href=\"https://tiptap.dev/extensions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">other extensions</a></li></ul>\"\"\"\n\ncomponent = dmc.TypographyStylesProvider(\n    dcc.Markdown(content, dangerously_allow_html=True, id=\"default\"),\n)\n```"
