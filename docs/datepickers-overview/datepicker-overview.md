### DatePicker

[DatePicker](/components/datepicker) allows users to select a date, date range, or multiple dates from a calendar.  It does not have an input field.  

Note: Many `DatePicker` props (for example,  `minDate`, `maxDate`, `excludeDates`, `allowLevelChange`, `firstDayOfWeek`,
`renderDay`) apply across other Mantine date and time picker components. Refer to the DatePicker section for details and example for these shared props.

### DatePickerInput

[DatePickerInput](/components/datepickerinput): Select single dates, multiple dates (`type="multiple"`), or date 
ranges (`type="range"`). This option **does not** allow free text input.


.. exec::docs.datepickerinput.range
    :code: false

### DateInput

[DateInput](/components/datepickerinput): Allows free form text input of dates, as well as selecting a date from a calendar.


.. exec::docs.dateinput.simple
    :code: false

### MonthPickerInput

[MonthPickerInput](/components/monthpickerinput): Use when only the month value is needed.


.. exec::docs.monthpickerinput.simple
    :code: false

### YearPickerInput
[YearPickerInput](/components/yearpickerinput): Use when only the year value is needed.

.. exec::docs.yearpickerinput.simple
    :code: false


### TimeInput
[TimeInput](/components/timeinput): is based on the native `input[type="time"]` element and does not support most of
advanced features like choosing time format or custom dropdown with time select. If you need more features, use
`TimePicker` component instead.

### TimePicker
[TimePicker](/components/timepicker): Advanced time selection with features like dropdowns for hours, minutes, seconds,
and 12-hour/24-hour formats, and time pre-sets.


.. exec::docs.timepicker.withdropdown
    :code: false

.. exec::docs.timepicker.presetsgroup
    :code: false


### TimeGrid
[TimeGrid](/components/timegrid)  captures time value from the user with a predefined set of options.

.. exec::docs.timegrid.interactive
    :code: false

### DateTimePicker
[DateTimePicker](/components/): Selects both date and time from user.

.. exec::docs.datetimepicker.simple
    :code: false


### CSS Extensions

As of DMC 1.2.0, Date component styles are bundled automatically, so you no longer need to include a separate CSS file.
If you're using an older version of DMC, refer to the [migration guide](/migration) for instructions on including optional stylesheets.
