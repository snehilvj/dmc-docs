### Simple Example

`Tree` component is used to display hierarchical data. `Tree` component has minimal styling by default, you can
customize styles with Styles API.

.. exec::docs.tree.simple

### Data

Data passed to the `data` prop should follow these rules:

- Data must be an array
- Each item in the array represents a node in the tree
- Each node must be a dictionary with value and label keys
- Each node can have children key with an array of child nodes
- The value of each node must be unique


```python
# ✅ Valid data, all values are unique
valid_data = [
    {
        "value": "src",
        "label": "src",
        "children": [
            {"value": "src/components", "label": "components"},
            {"value": "src/hooks", "label": "hooks"},
        ],
    },
    {"value": "package.json", "label": "package.json"},
]

# ❌ Invalid data, values are not unique (components is used twice)
invalid_data = [
    {
        "value": "src",
        "label": "src",
        "children": [{"value": "components", "label": "components"}],
    },
    {"value": "components", "label": "components"},
]

```

### Icon Side

The expanded and collapsed icons are on the left side of the label by default.  To move them to the right side, set `iconSide="right`


.. exec::docs.tree.iconside


### Remove Expanded Icon

By default the `Tree` includes a chevron to indicate expanded and collapsed nodes.  To remove the icons, set `expandedIcon=None`


.. exec::docs.tree.expandedicon-none


### Change Expanded Icon

Use any icon in the `expandedIcon` prop.  If no `collapsedIcon` is set, the icon will be rotated to indicate the collapsed state.

.. exec::docs.tree.expandedicon-custom

### Change Expanded and Collapsed Icons

When both the  `expandedIcon` and `collapsedIcon` props are set, the icons will not be rotated.


.. exec::docs.tree.expanded-collapsed

### Set Expanded state

To set the state of the nodes, use the `expanded` prop.  Note that leaf nodes can be included, but it will only change
the expanded/collapsed display of the nodes with children.


.. exec::docs.tree.expanded-preset

### Expand or Collapse All

Expand all will include all items of the `data` prop in the `expanded` prop.

.. exec::docs.tree.expand-all

### Expanded State in callbacks.

When using the expanded property as a callback input to track the user's selected expanded state, note that the `expanded`
list may include or exclude leaf nodes (nodes without children) depending on user interaction.

This happens because users can toggle the state of leaf nodes, even though they don’t affect how the tree data is 
displayed. To handle this, ensure your callback logic accounts for the possibility that leaf nodes may or may not
be present in the `expanded` prop.

Note also that the nodes included in the `expanded` prop are ordered based on user interation and the order of operations.

### With Checkboxes

Use the `checked` prop to set or track the checked items.  Note that only leaves can be checked, and the order will be
based on user interation and the order of operations. 

.. exec::docs.tree.checkboxes


### Custom Tree rendering

By default, `dmc.Tree` includes a built-in `renderNode` function that covers most common use cases. It requires no 
JavaScript and supports some customization through props like `checkboxes`, `expandedIcon`, and `iconSide`.

If you need more control over how each node is rendered, such as using custom icons based on the data, arranging content
differently or advanced styling, you can provide your own `renderNode` function written in JavaScript. This advanced
feature is designed for use cases that go beyond what the built-in options support.

#### Ignored Props

When you supply your own `renderNode` function, the following props are ignored:

* `checkboxes`
* `expandedIcon`
* `collapsedIcon`
* `iconSide`

These props only apply when you're using the default built-in renderer. If you're using a custom `renderNode`, you are
responsible for rendering icons, checkboxes, or any other visual element.


#### Example: Files Tree 

.. functions_as_props::

.. exec::docs.tree.renderNode
    :code: false

.. sourcetabs::docs/tree/renderNode.py, assets/examples-js/tree.js
    :defaultExpanded: true
    :withExpandedButton: true

#### Example:  Tree with Checkboxes

.. functions_as_props::


If the "With Checkboxes" example above does not meet your needs, you can use the `renderNode` prop to fully customize
how each tree node is rendered using JavaScript.

When using a custom `renderNode`, you are responsible for implementing the checkbox and expand/collapse logic yourself.
To handle the checked state, you'll need to render a `CheckboxIndicator` manually inside your custom render function
and call `tree.checkNode(...)` or `tree.uncheckNode(...)` to update it.


.. exec::docs.tree.renderNodeCheckbox
    :code: false

.. sourcetabs::docs/tree/renderNodeCheckbox.py, assets/examples-js/tree_checkbox.js
    :defaultExpanded: true
    :withExpandedButton: true

#### renderNode Arguments

The `renderNode` function receives a single `payload` object with the following fields:

```js
export interface RenderTreeNodePayload {
  /** Node level in the tree */
  level: number;

  /** `true` if the node is expanded, applicable only for nodes with `children` */
  expanded: boolean;

  /** `true` if the node has non-empty `children` array */
  hasChildren: boolean;

  /** `true` if the node is selected */
  selected: boolean;

  /** Node data from the `data` prop of `Tree` */
  node: TreeNodeData;

  /** Tree controller instance, return value of `useTree` hook */
  tree: TreeController;

  /** Props to spread into the root node element */
  elementProps: {
    className: string;
    style: React.CSSProperties;
    onClick: (event: React.MouseEvent) => void;
    'data-selected': boolean | undefined;
    'data-value': string;
    'data-hovered': boolean | undefined;
  };
}

```
