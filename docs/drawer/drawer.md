### Simple Example

This is a basic example of dmc.Drawer. Set the `opened` property to open the drawer. The drawer can be controlled in following ways:

* programmatically (using callbacks)
* by clicking on the cross button (if not disabled using `withCloseButton` prop)
* by clicking outside the drawer area (if not disabled using `closeOnClickOutside` prop)
* by pressing the ESC key (if not disabled using `closeOnEscape` prop)

### Different Sizes

Set the size of the drawer using the `size` prop.

.. exec::docs.drawer.sizes

### Placement

By default, Drawer will start to appear from the left, but this position can be customized by setting the `position` 
prop.

.. exec::docs.drawer.placement

### Transition

You can customize transition, timing function and duration for Drawer transition.

.. exec::docs.drawer.transition


### Drawer Stack

Use `DrawerStack` component to render multiple drawers at the same time. `DrawerStack` keeps track of opened drawers, 
manages `z-index` values, focus trapping and `closeOnEscape` behavior.

Differences from using multiple Drawer components:

- `DrawerStack` children must be `ManagedDrawer` components
- `DrawerStack` manages `z-index` values â€“ drawers that are opened later will always have higher `z-index` value disregarding their order in the DOM
- `DrawerStack` disables focus trap and `Escape` key handling for all drawers except the one that is currently opened
- Drawers that are not currently visible are present in the DOM but are hidden with `opacity: 0` and `pointer-events: none`
- Only one overlay is rendered at a time
