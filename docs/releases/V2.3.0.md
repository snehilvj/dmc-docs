Based on Mantine 8.3.1

### New DirectionProvider component 

Mantine supports right-to-left (RTL) layouts out of the box. Try the new direction toggle in the header of these 
docs — one click and the entire app flips to RTL. Not just the text, but every component adapts. Check out the [sliders](/components/slider)
in RTL mode, they feel completely natural.

See the [RTL (right-to-left) direction guide](/rtl)  for details on enabling RTL direction and adding a toggle to your app.


```python
app.layout = dmc.DirectionProvider(
    dmc.MantineProvider([
     # your app layout
     ]),
    direction="rtl"
)
```

### New MiniCalendar component

The new [MiniCalendar](/components/mini-calendar) component makes it easy to add compact calendars.


.. exec::docs.minicalendar.simple

### Progress vertical orientation

[Progress](/components/progress) now supports vertical orientation:

.. exec::docs.progress.orientation


### RichTextEditor upgraded to Tiptap V3

[RichTextEditor](/components/richtexteditor) is now built on Tiptap V3 enabling features like  `BackgroundColor`,
`FontFamily`, `FontSize`, `LineHeight`.

Note: This change has no known breaking changes, but customizations may be affected.  See our [migration guide,](https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/migration) for details.
  

Here is an example of creating custom buttons to change the font size:


.. exec::docs.richtexteditor.custom_controls_fontsize
    :code: false

.. sourcetabs::docs/richtexteditor/custom_controls_fontsize.py, assets/examples-js/rte_fontsize.js
    :defaultExpanded: false
    :withExpandedButton: true 

### ScrollArea scrollTo prop

The [ScrollArea](/components/scrollarea), now includes a `scrollTo` prop to control the viewport position.

  * `top` – The vertical position (pixels or percentage string, from '0%' to '100%')
  * `left` – The horizontal position (pixels or percentage string, from '0%' to '100%')
  * `behavior` – `auto` (instant) or `smooth` (animated, default)

.. exec::docs.scrollarea.scrollto


### New ScrollAreaAutosize component

`ScrollAreaAutosize` component creates a scrollable container once a given max-height is reached.

.. exec::docs.scrollarea.autosize



### New Overlay component

[Overlay](/components/overaly) creates a customizable  layer over content or the entire viewport. It’s useful for dimming
effects, interactive overlays, and custom loading states. You can configure opacity, color, and positioning.

.. exec::docs.overlay.simple


### MultiSelect improvement

[MultiSelect](/components/multiselect) now supports `clearSearchOnChange=False` allowing multiple selectios from the same search query.

.. exec::docs.multiselect.clearsearch

### Autocomplete debounce prop

The [Autocomplete](/components/autocomplete) component now supports the [debounce prop.](/debounce) This delays the update of the `value` until
the user stops interacting, reducing callback frequency.

### LLMs.txt
You can now use LLMs.txt file with Cursor and other IDEs. The file is automatically updated with each release and
includes every demo and documentation page from the DMC docs site. It is about 1.6MB. You can find the latest version 
of LLMs.txt and documentation in the  [LLMs](/llms) section.
