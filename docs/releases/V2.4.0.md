Based on Mantine 8.3.1

### Chart components now supports additional functions as props

THe `AreaChart`, `BarChart`, `BubbleChart`, `CompositeChart`, `LineChart`, and `ScatterChart` now  accept functions for the following props:

- `xAxisProps`, `yAxisProps`, `gridProps`, `rightYAxisProps` (all charts)
- `zAxisProps` (`BubbleChart` only)

See the [Functions As Props guide](/functions-as-props)  for details.


#### Example format x axis tick labels

This example uses a JavaScript function to format dates on the x axis that are provided as datetime objects.

.. sourcetabs::docs/areachart/xaxisprops.py, assets/examples-js/format-datetime.js
    :defaultExpanded: true
    :withExpandedButton: true


### AI-friendly documentation

LLM friendly documentation is now available for Dash Mantine Components. It follows the LLMs.txt standard, allowing AI tools like ChatGPT, Cursor,
Windsurf, and Claude to better understand DMC components and props.

New in this release:

* You can now generate a custom `llms.txt` file that includes only the components you use, improving AI accuracy and response speed.
* Each docs page includes a “Copy for LLMs” button, making it easy to copy that page’s content in an AI-friendly format.  Use this when you want to paste a few pages directly into a chat session (e.g. ChatGPT or Cursor).

The full file and customization options are available in the [LLMs section](/llms).

### Other notable updates

This release includes:
- Mantine patch update 8.3.1 through 8.3.6  See the  [Mantine Releases](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/releases) for more details.

- Improved rendering on certain components such as the `Stepper`.  Thanks to @chgiesse for [PR 664](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/pull/664)
