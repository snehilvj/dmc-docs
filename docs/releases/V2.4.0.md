Based on Mantine 8.3.6

### New: Copy to Clipboard Components

The new `CopyButton` and `CustomCopyButton` provide clipboard functionality like `dcc.Clipboard`, but adds Mantine 
styling and customization.

Highlights:

- Simple one-line setup for copying text to the clipboard
- Customizable icons, colors, and labels for copied state
- Support for copying from another component using `target_id`
- Trigger copy actions in callbacks with `triggerCopy=True`
- Build fully custom buttons using JavaScript functions in the `CustomCopyButton`

Check out the new [Copy Button docs](/components/copybutton)



.. exec::docs.copybutton.children

A fun demo of `CopyButton` and `target_id`: need a quick way to say “no”? Fetch a random answer from [No As A Service](https://github.com/hotheadhacker/no-as-a-service) and copy it with a single click.


.. exec::docs.copybutton.no-as-a-service


### More chart props now support functions

The `AreaChart`, `BarChart`, `BubbleChart`, `CompositeChart`, `LineChart`, and `ScatterChart` now accept functions for these props:

* `xAxisProps`, `yAxisProps`, `gridProps`, `rightYAxisProps` (all charts)
* `zAxisProps` (`BubbleChart` only)

See the [Functions As Props guide](/functions-as-props) for details.

#### Example: format x-axis tick labels

This example uses a JavaScript function to format x-axis tick labels for datetime values.

.. exec::docs.areachart.xaxisprops
    :code: false


.. sourcetabs::docs/areachart/xaxisprops.py, assets/examples-js/format-datetime.js
    :defaultExpanded: true
    :withExpandedButton: true


### AI-friendly documentation

LLM-friendly documentation is now available for Dash Mantine Components. It follows the `llms.txt` standard, enabling AI
tools like ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude to better understand DMC components and props.

New in this release:
* Generate a custom `llms.txt` file that includes only the components you use — improving AI accuracy and response speed.
* Each docs page now includes a "Copy for LLMs" button for copying AI-friendly content directly into a chat.

See the [LLMs section](/llms) for full details and customization options.


### Other notable updates

* Mantine patch updates from 8.3.1 through 8.3.6. See the [Mantine Releases](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/releases) for details.
* Improved rendering in several components, including the `Stepper`. Thanks to @chgiesse for [PR #664](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/pull/664).
