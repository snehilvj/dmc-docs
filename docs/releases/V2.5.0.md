Based on Mantine 8.3.13

See [Changelog](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/releases/tag/2.5.0)  



### New TableofContents Component

Use the `TableOfContents` component to display a table of contents similar to the sidebar in these docs. The
component tracks scroll position and highlights current heading in the list.

Check out all the new features in the [Table Of Contents docs](/components/table-of-contents).

*This component was added by @deadkex in [PR #513](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/pull/513)*

.. exec::docs.tableofcontents.interactive
    :code: false


### Custom DMC components

You can now build custom Dash components that use Mantine the same way Dash Mantine Components does.

Previously, custom components built with the standard Dash component template had to bundle their own copy of Mantine.
Because of this, they could not access the `MantineProvider` used by DMC, which meant themes, styles, and context did
not work as expected.

DMC now exports `MantineHooks` and `MantineCore`, allowing custom components to use the same Mantine hooks, utilities,
and context as the built-in components. This enables a wide range of custom components, such as building advanced `Select`
or `MultiSelect` on top of Mantine’s [Combobox](https://mantine.dev/core/combobox/), while keeping theme and behavior consistent inside a Dash app.

For examples and step-by-step instructions, see the custom DMC components in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dmc_custom_components).

*This feature was added by @BSd3v in [PR# 653](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/pull/653)*  

### Improved typing

The Python types for DMC components have been improved to better reflect supported props and values. This provides more
accurate type hints, better autocomplete, and clearer static checking in editors like VS Code and PyCharm.


### New in the docs:  DatePicker presets

This feature has been available since dash-mantine-components==2.1.0, but was just added to the documentation thanks
to first time contributor [@EstanVW25](https://github.com/snehilvj/dmc-docs/pull/280)


[DatePicker](https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/components/datepicker#presets), [DatePickerInput](https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/components/datepicker#presets) and [DateTimePicker](https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/components/datetimepicker#presets) 
now support `presets` prop that allows you to add custom date presets. Presets are displayed next to the calendar:


.. exec::docs.datepicker.presets

### Other notable updates

* Mantine patch updates from 8.3.10 through 8.3.13. See the [Mantine Releases](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/releases) for details.

- AppShell: Add static `mode` support for nested app shells
- Added `selectFirstOptionOnDropdownOpen` and `openOnFocus`props to Combobox based components.
- Fixed `PinInput` so that `value` can be set initially and in a callback
