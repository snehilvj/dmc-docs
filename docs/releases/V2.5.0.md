Based on Mantine 8.3.13

See [Changelog](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/releases/tag/2.5.0)  



### New TableofContents Component

Use the `TableOfContents` component to display a table of contents similar to the sidebar in these docs. The
component tracks scroll position and highlights current heading in the list.

Check out all the new features in the [Table Of Contents docs](/components/table-of-contents).

*This component was added by @deadkex in [PR #513](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/pull/513)*

.. exec::docs.tableofcontents.interactive
    :code: false


### Custom DMC components

`MantineHooks` and `MantineCore` are now exported from dash-mantine-components, giving component authors access to the same hooks and utilities DMC uses internally.

This allows you to make custom components, such as a `Select` built on lower-level building blocks like [Combobox](https://mantine.dev/core/combobox/), while maintaining consistent theming in Dash.

For more details and examples, see custom DMC components based on  [Mantine’s custom Combobox examples](https://mantine.dev/combobox/?e=BasicSelect) in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dmc_custom_components).

*This feature was added by @BSd3v in [PR# 653](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/pull/653)*  

### Improved typing

The Python types for DMC components have been improved to better reflect supported props and values. This provides more
accurate type hints, better autocomplete, and clearer static checking in editors like VS Code and PyCharm.


### New in the docs:  DatePicker presets

This feature has been available since dash-mantine-components==2.1.0, but was just added to the documentation thanks
to first time contributor [@EstanVW25](https://github.com/snehilvj/dmc-docs/pull/280)


[DatePicker](https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/components/datepicker#presets), [DatePickerInput](https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/components/datepicker#presets) and [DateTimePicker](https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/components/datetimepicker#presets) 
now support `presets` prop that allows you to add custom date presets. Presets are displayed next to the calendar:


.. exec::docs.datepicker.presets

### Other notable updates

* Mantine patch updates from 8.3.10 through 8.3.13. See the [Mantine Releases](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/releases) for details.

- AppShell: Add static `mode` support for nested app shells
- Added `selectFirstOptionOnDropdownOpen` and `openOnFocus`props to Combobox based components.
- Fixed `PinInput` so that `value` can be set initially and in a callback
