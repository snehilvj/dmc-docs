### 🎉 Dash Mantine Components v2.1 (Powered by Mantine v8.1)

We’re excited to announce a new release of Dash Mantine Components! This update brings a range of new components, 
enhanced features, and improvements to make building beautiful Dash apps even easier. 

### What's New
 
* New `ModalStack` and `DrawerStack` components for layered UIs
* Function support expanded across more components and props
* Custom rendering options for calendar and tree views
* UI refinements and new props across the board


### New ModalStack and DrawerStack components

Use `ModalStack` or `DrawerStack` to render and manage multiple modals or drawers at once. These components handle focus, z-index stacking, and Escape key closing automatically.


Check out this ModalStack example:

### Calendar headerControlsOrder prop

Calendar-based components now support the `headerControlsOrder` prop, which lets you customize the layout of header buttons. The value is a dictionary using keys `'previous'`, `'next'`, and `'level'`.

.. exec::docs.datepicker.headercontrolsorder



### Slider Domain prop
`Slider` component now supports `domain` prop that allows setting the possible range of values independently of the min and max values:


.. exec::docs.slider.domain


### RangeSlider pushOnOverlap prop
`RangeSlider` component now supports `pushOnOverlap` prop that defines whether the slider should push the overlapping thumb when the user drags it.

.. exec::docs.slider.pushonoverlap

### Additional Props Now Support Functions

Function props were introduced in DMC v2.0, allowing you to pass JavaScript functions to certain component props for dynamic formatting, styling, and rendering.

In v2.1, this support has been expanded to include even more components and props — including calendar inputs, AutoComplete, and Tree.

You can now customize things like:

* Highlighting or disabling specific dates, months, or years in the calendar, month and year pickers
* Modifying how AutoComplete options are rendered or filtered
* Fully controlling how each node in a Tree is displayed

For a complete list of newly supported function props, [see the table in the docs](/functions-as-props#supported-props-in-v2-1).
And for guidance on writing these functions — or generating them from Python using AI — see the [Functions as Props docs](/functions-as-props).

#### Example: Add an indicator to a calendar day

.. exec::docs.datepicker.renderDay
    :code: false

.. sourcetabs::docs/datepicker/renderDay.py, assets/examples-js/renderDay.js
    :defaultExpanded: true
    :withExpandedButton: true


#### Example: Add props to year and month control

Customize the year, month, and day controls using `getYearControlProps`, `getMonthControlProps`, and `getDayProps`. Each function receives a date and returns props to apply to that control.

This example:

* Highlights every Friday the 13th using `getDayProps`
* Disables June and highlights February using `getMonthControlProps` (In the month picker)
* Disables 2026 and highlights 2025 using `getYearControlProps`  (In the year picker)


.. exec::docs.datepicker.getprops
    :code: false

.. sourcetabs::docs/datepicker/getprops.py, assets/examples-js/getprops.js
    :defaultExpanded: true
    :withExpandedButton: true

#### Example:  Custom Rendering of Tree component

You can fully control how each node is rendered in the `Tree` component using the `renderNode` function. This allows 
custom icons, layout, or complex styling beyond the built-in options.

### AutoComplete improvements

Thanks to first-time contributor @ihor-lazariev for adding the following features in [PR #604](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/pull/604):

* Support for functions in `renderOption` and `filter` props
* New `clearButtonProps` and `clearable` props

.. exec::docs.autocomplete.renderOptions



### Other Changes

See the [Mantine Changelog](https://mantine.dev/changelog/8-1-0/#other-changes) for more.

* [`presets` for DatePicker](https://mantine.dev/changelog/8-1-0/#datepicker-presets): Adds predefined date ranges next to the calendar
* [Popover behavior improvements](https://mantine.dev/changelog/8-1-0/#popover-middlewares-improvements): More consistent dropdown positioning with dynamic content
* All components now support the `bdrs` style prop for border radius
* `Tooltip` now supports the `autoContrast` prop for improved legibility

### Quick Start

Just a reminder:

* With Dash ≥ 3.0.0, there’s no need to manually set the React version.
* With DMC ≥ 1.2.0, you no longer need to include optional stylesheets such as `dmc.styles.ALL`.

Here’s a minimal app to get started:

```python
import dash_mantine_components as dmc
from dash import Dash

app = Dash()

app.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(
    dmc.Alert(
        "Welcome to Dash Mantine Components",
        title="Hello!",
        color="violet",
    )
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
