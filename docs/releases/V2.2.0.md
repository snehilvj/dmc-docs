Released August 19, 2025
Based on Mantine 8.2.5


### Source edit mode in RichTextEditor

[RichTextEditor](/components/richtexteditor) now supports source code edit mode.

.. exec::docs.richtexteditor.sourcecode


### Custom controls in RichTextEditor 
Use `CustomControl` in the `controlsGroups` to create create custom controls in the `toolbar`. Mantine wraps Tiptap V2.9.
To see the commands available for use in your custom controls see the [Tiptap documentation](https://v2.tiptap.dev/docs/editor/api/commands)

Thanks to @BSd3v for adding this feature in [PR #629](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/pull/629)

.. functions_as_props::

.. exec::docs.richtexteditor.custom_controls_table
    :code: false

.. sourcetabs::docs/richtexteditor/custom_controls_table.py, assets/examples-js/rte_table_controls.js, assets/examples/rte-table.css
    :defaultExpanded: false
    :withExpandedButton: true 

 
### Bar value label props

[Bar Chart](/components/barchart) now supports passing props down to [recharts LabelList](https://recharts.org/en-US/api/LabelList) component with `valueLabelProps` prop. 

Thanks to first time contributor @CGaul for adding this feature in [PR #620](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/pull/620)! 

.. exec::docs.barchart.bar_value_label_props



### Styles API attributes
You now can pass attributes to inner elements of all components that support [Styles API](/styles-api) with `attributes`
prop. For example, it can be used to add data attributes for testing purposes:

.. exec::docs.styles-api.attributes


### Container grid strategy

 [Container](/components/container) now supports `strategy="grid"` prop which enables more features.

Differences from the default `strategy="block"`:

- Uses `display: grid` instead of `display: block`
- Does not include default inline padding
- Does not set `max-width` on the root element (uses grid template columns instead)

Features supported by `strategy="grid"`:

- Everything that is supported by `strategy="block"`
- Children with `data-breakout` attribute take the entire width of the container's parent element
- Children with `data-container` inside `data-breakout` have the same width as the main grid column

Example of using breakout feature:

.. exec::docs.container.strategy
    :code: false


.. sourcetabs::docs/container/strategy.py
    :defaultExpanded: false
    :withExpandedButton: true


### Tooltip Target

New [Tooltip](/components/tooltip) `target` prop is an alternative to `children`. It accepts a string (selector), an HTML
element or a `ref` object with HTML element. Use `target` prop when you do not render tooltip target as JSX element—for
example, in a clientside callback.

Example of using target prop with a string selector:

.. exec::docs.tooltip.target

### autoSelectOnBlur prop

[Select](/components/select) and [Autocomplete](/components/autocomplete) components now support `autoSelectOnBlur` prop.
Use it to automatically select the highlighted option when the input loses focus. To see this feature in action: select
an option with up/down arrows, then click outside the input:


.. exec::docs.select.autoselectonblur

### clearSearchOnFocus prop

For searchable [Select](/components/select) components, when `clearSearchOnFocus=True`, the search input will be cleared each time the
field gains focus.  This is useful when you want the user to start with an empty search box each time, without having 
to manually delete the existing text.  

Thanks @vaughnfuelling1 for the [feature request](https://github.com/snehilvj/dash-mantine-components/issues/626)!


.. exec::docs.select.clearsearchonfocus


### Accordion chevronIconSize prop
- The [Accordion](/components/accordion) default `chevronSize` prop value was changed to `auto` to allow using dynamic icon sizes.
- The `Accordion` now supports `chevronIconSize` prop to configure size of the default chevron icon.

.. exec::docs.accordion.interactive
    :code: false



### New in the Docs

#### New Autocomplete component section


Use [Autocomplete](/components/autocomplete) component in the following cases:

- You want to allow user to enter any value
- You want to display suggestions to the user based on the input value
- You want to preserve user input on blur if option was not selected from the dropdown
- `value` and `label` of the option are the same.

.. exec::docs.autocomplete.simple

#### Layout Overview

The new [Layout Overview](/layout-overview) section helps you choose the right component for your use case:

* `Grid` – Use when columns have different sizes (for example, first column is 1/3 width, second is 2/3).
* `SimpleGrid` – Use for equal-width columns.
* `Group` – Arrange items horizontally.
* `Stack` – Arrange items vertically.
* `Flex` – Create both horizontal and vertical flexbox layouts. More flexible than `Group` or `Stack`, but requires more configuration.

This section also explains the differences between `Container`, `Paper`, and `Box`, and provides an overview of
`AppShell` for adding headers, footers, navbars, and asides to your app.


#### Theming and Style section updates

The Theming and Styles are now two sections to make the information easier to find.  Plus there is a new
[Mantine Overview](/mantine-overview) section to help understand the basic features of the Mantine API.

### Patch Release 2.2.1
 - Updates to Mantine 8.2.7
 - Fixes regression where nested `NavLink` did not open on click
 - Fixes `MulitSelect` and `Select` - changes to the `data` and `value` are batched so they only trigger a single callback

### Quick Start

Just a reminder:

* With Dash ≥ 3.0.0, there’s no need to manually set the React version.
* With DMC ≥ 1.2.0, you no longer need to include optional stylesheets such as `dmc.styles.ALL`.

Here’s a minimal app to get started:

.. exec::docs.getting-started.hello_world
   :code: false

```python
import dash_mantine_components as dmc
from dash import Dash

app = Dash()

app.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(
    dmc.Alert(
        "Welcome to Dash Mantine Components",
        title="Hello!",
        color="violet",
    )
)

app.run(debug=True)
```
