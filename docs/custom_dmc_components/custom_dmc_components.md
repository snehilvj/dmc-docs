As of DMC version 2.5.0, `MantineHooks`, `MantineCore`, and `MantineDates` are exported from dash-mantine-components, giving component authors access to the same hooks and utilities DMC uses internally.

This allows you to build custom components, such as a `Select` built on lower-level building blocks like `Combobox`, while maintaining consistent theming in Dash.

For more details, step by step instructions and working examples, see custom DMC components inspired by [Mantine’s custom Combobox examples](https://mantine.dev/combobox/?e=BasicSelect) in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dmc_custom_components).
