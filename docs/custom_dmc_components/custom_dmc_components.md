*New in dash-mantine-components 2.5.0*

`MantineHooks` and `MantineCore` are now exported from dash-mantine-components, giving component authors access to the same hooks and utilities DMC uses internally.

This allows you to make custom components, such as a `Select` built on lower-level building blocks like [Combobox](https://mantine.dev/core/combobox/), while maintaining consistent theming in Dash.

For more details and examples, see custom DMC components based on  [Mantine’s custom Combobox examples](https://mantine.dev/combobox/?e=BasicSelect) in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dmc_custom_components).
